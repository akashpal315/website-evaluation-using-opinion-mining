I bought 3 sets of these blades for my cars. They lasted 2 weeks (at the most) on average in the summer. Bosch or Anco blades usually work for 2 years. It's up to you to decide which blades to buy!
Follow-up: I see some people find my review not helpful, you know what: I tried to warn you. Obviously You either have too much money or You're stockholders of RainX. My advice for You: buy garbage, support economy

I bought two pair in different sizes and one pair was great but the other pair had deteriorated edges that left water in lines from the first use and one lock didn't secure the blade to the arm well. I had to buy a replacement immediately

Lasts only 2 weeks! Try them if you don't believe me

What a bad product!  They didn't last two weeks before they began to smear my windshield

I had a pretty dirty car and I used the Mr. Clean Starter Kit. I followed all the directions.I also washed my car in the shade, and I rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. I waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. It still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing I did during the soaping step. It even took more water than what I would have used washing it the old fashion way. I looked that the FAQ sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. It's just a hassle. At least I can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. Otherwise it's a waste of money

I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box.  Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things.  So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one

I bought this product on a whim.  I was looking for carwash detergent at Safeway, and the Mr. Clean AutoDry was on sale.  Curious, I gave it a try.

First of all, this unit wastes a LOT of water.  After washing and rinsing, you have to apply filtered water all over the car from a distance of one feet.  It feels like spray painting.

Then you wait for the water to evaporate.  Problem is, I live in San Franisco, CA -- nothing dries in this climate without help.  If I hadn't hand dried my car, I'd still be waiting for the water to evaporate.

Another odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using the Mr. Clean soap and unit.  It's as though it left a residue.  I'm not sure what it is.

But I'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow, the old-fashioned way ..

Ok It's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate. I thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it (and even then the edges are blurry).

I cannot believe they put this on the market.  Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out.  It's title is true - it is a water magnet.

Advertised as easy to install. Just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it......WRONG. If your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle. They also don't tell you it is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOTORCYCLE RELAYS. If you get past all of this it does have a great sound

I own both the original unbreakable autolock (with the flat key) and the autolock pro (with the round key). The original autolock never failed to open after 10+ years of use on two cars. The autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use. This is not a key problem, because I could not open it with two original keys. I eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it. I recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device

This product was purchased as a Christmas gift for my father, unfortunately it did not perform for him. I was replacing this with one that he has had for over 10 years and that one still works and outperfomed this brand new model.

Fatally flawed.  Magnificently compact, clever design, but broke first time I used it--el-cheapo plastic clamps snapped.  Service center wouldn't repair it, so I had to return it.  An otherwise beautiful design, with a frustrating Achilles heel.  AARRGH!

Had the Reese Sleeved lock on my Tow Hitch Step  for a year now &amp; damn if I can get the thing off !!!  We have tried Graphite (dry) Graphite Liquid
everything short of cutting the thing off. The key  (a flat one) won't BUDGE in the lock.  

Newer Reese towpower locks have round keys (like Vending machine keys) on them.  My cover has been on the lock ever since I bought it &amp; today it is 87 degrees outside. Still the lock won't allow the key to turn in it. after 10 minutes of working on it with the CTP keys it budged a little, but it still didn't unlock ALL the way. 

Tomorrow I am going to get my Custom Truck specialist to torch it off. Next time I will buy the MASTERLOCK  Brand.

I just received the gauge and I'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes:

- The hose didn't seal well on the tire valve
- WHen bleeding air, the display didn't update. You have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. This is ridiculous.
- The display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itsel
</review_text><review_text>
If this gauge cost $20 I would give it a high rating, but even at the discounted $35 price I see for these gauges I think it is bad value, let alone the nearly $50 it cost me!

AS mentioned hose is VERY INFLEXIBLE at cool, not just cold temps, general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this, mine is now leaking badly and I am trying to repair with quality materials, as I still hope to use the gauge part anyway. 

I would NOT BUY AGAIN
</review_text><review_text>
It appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously.  The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.

The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.

I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery.  So essentially the gauge was useless.  The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.

Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it
</review_text><review_text>
As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  Calling it a "racing" gauge is ridiculous
</review_text><review_text>
I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.

Six weeks later (November 27th) I received a properly functioning gauge.  So it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  There was just a very large run of defective ones.  At this point, I would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.

If yours is defective, you should contact Accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240.

Dimensions are confusing/inaccurate.  Stated height of 11.5 inches is not correct--perhaps this is shipping container.  Actual product is about 8.5 inches high, but taking into account the cradle for tire, only raises the vehicle about 6 inches

I got this item for my coffee-loving truck driver husband.  When we took it out of the box, we saw the obvious problem:  the "mug" is tiny!  Only a bit larger than an espresso cup.

This bag was junk on a 2001 4Runner.  The poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload.

Spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware.  Great service from Amazon, terrible service from Lund

I had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. I bought this one thinking it would be better. The first time I used it I couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings.  It also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. It would disappear before i could read it fully.

I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.

Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items

i wouldn't recommend this product.  The positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it... I, as I was stranded, rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w/ the remaining half of the clamp.

I will be returning to the store tonight, returning this item, and purchasing a different charger

It's a pain because to save time you need to install it permanently to make it worth it.  Then you can never use that window for anything else. It's a pain because it will NOT work on tinted windows.

Don't waste your money. That's the short version. No stars for this P.O.S. Want more? OK - once you've fiddled around and fitted the rubber strips to your window, hooked on the device, rolled up your window (facing the sun, of course) you're now late for whatever it was you just parked to go do. Oh yes, and it doesn't do anything other than spin a joke fan that couldn't move a feather. I put my hand in front of it and felt nothing - no wonder my car still feels like an oven. We can't drive off with it on, as the wind noise is unbearable even after unhooking the unit. Why? Because of the 'sealing' rubber strip you've hooked over the top of the glass leaving a nice 4mm gap for the wind.

I purchaced this product because its a great idea.  The problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel. Also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out. Also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window.

Hopefully they can take this design an improve the suction and maybe add a battery. Similar to the solar lights you put in your driveway

Absolutely useless.  Do not buy this product.  You are wasting your money.  Learn from me.  I wasted on two!  They are tiny tiny fans that move hardly any air at all.  Also they DO NOT work on tinted windows.  Trust me.

I also purchased this product &amp; was extremely disappointed when I found out it did NOT work.

To turn off your check engine light on most vehicles, with your vehicle turned off, pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle. In most cases the light will shut off. If there is truly a problem with you car, the light will either not stay off or come right back on. You do not need this device to do that. The second problem is if your car does need attention, this device won't really properly diagnose or certainly won't fix it and you'll still have to go to a mechanic. So I'm left wondering what good this is

It is ok for small dogs, large dogs will knock it down
</review_text><review_text>
Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down.  It also probably depends on the dog.  If the dog really wants to get past it, they will.  If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a "psychological barrier", this would be ok.  Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the "trombone" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place

This is THE worst smelling "freshener" I have ever used. Its just a terrible smell. Like the other reviewer said, its very chemical in nature. I sprayed som in my living room to see what it was like and.....WOW. I opened the windoes pretty quick, I could not imagine this in a hot car. I picked it up for 1.50 at a BigLots and I feel ripped off.

If you've seen the movie "Cars" and figure that it's time that you gave your rusty bucket the "Radiator Springs" make-over special, you might just be tempted to get yourself a batch of this stuff to make it smell as good as it looks.

Sure - it says "New Car Scent", and it has a picture of a car and a nice ribbon and everything - but I would definitely not use this stuff in my car.  First of all, it doesn't smell anything like the interior of a new car, and inhaling this stuff in that small an area would be lethal, even if you drive a Hummer.  It is super-concentrated, and a one second blast is enough to saturate a 10 ft x 10 ft room with an unpleasant chemical smell, which might just be able to eliminate you and yours along with the airborne bacteria, smoke and odors.
 
I can't vouch for any of the claims of air cleansing, sanitizing, bacteria reduction or removal of smoke and odors, because after the first test spray (in my office on a Friday afternoon) I vacated the premises under duress, and by Monday morning it had thankfully dissipated.  I've never used it again, and even though it may conceivably be the best airborne germ killing thing-gummy ever invented, the smell makes it impossible to use in the presence of living, breathing people.
 
To be fair, the write-up never actually states that it is for cars, instead listing schools, medical facilities and food-processing areas, but then why on earth would you want any of these places to smell like a new car?  And why would you need a one ounce bottle of product for your factory?  The claims of deodorizing and leaving a fresh fragrance certainly didn't happen for me, and unless you come from somewhere where the pollution smells worse than this, I couldn't recommend it.

I was so excited about this bag but it was a huge disappointment.  The description clearly indicates WATERPROOF, but in fact it is mostly water RESISTANT, an 8 on a scale of 1-10 according to the box.  and since our travel coincided with several rain storms, this was a very important differentiation!
the straps for the 'net' are extremely unmanageable and there are several key elements missing from the instructions.  having never used a roof top cargo bag before, this presented quite an obstacle for me.  there are loops through which you send the straps for the net that holds the bag down, the instructions make no mention of them, do you loop the strap through before or after you loop it through the luggage rack?  does it make a difference?  it took me 45 minutes just to get the thing attached to my roof due to trial and error (not counting loading time).
the clips themselves are very poor construction, one of them broke upon tightening and had to be makeshift tied instead.
the straps also do not tighten very easily, you have to feed the straps through the clips and then keep moving the clips back and forth until you get it to the length you want.
the stitching also started ripping when trying to close the very stubborn zipper.  the bag was not overstuffed.
I cannot recommend this product

March 14 FOLLOW UP REPORT: Pump found to stall and stop at 40 pounds pressure. Teresa K. Naeole of Q. Industries by phone said I could return pump and would be sent a more expensive tire pump in return. Returned pump was received at 159 Islington on February 16 at 12:55 pm. I have not received a new pump. I cannot get a response from telephone message requests at (303) 629 7700. Almost a month now. Yuk! Paul

I purchased the HV30 Portable Compressor because it promised rapid inflation of tires and blowup toys. The 140 pound pressure limit was certainly adequate. The price was right.

The Compressor comes with a hose that screws onto the compressor on one end and screws onto the tire valve stem on the other end. The compressor end thread was damaged. I had to use a pliers to tighten what should have been a hand tightened connection. Because the tire end screws on, air is lost as it is unscrewed after the tire is inflated. Most tire inflators come with a quick disconnect. Further, the compressor won't start against tire pressure if the connector hose is screwed on the tire valve. I had to start the compressor and then screw the hose onto the valve stem.

I haven't tried inflating a bike tire yet. I strongly suspect the air lost during unscrewing the connector hose will almost deflate the tire. This is just a great idea for inflating tires much faster than with pumps designed for much higher pressure limits but really poor engineering execution

My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work.  Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those "just in case" moments.  We plugged it in and have left it in since then.  Just this week our battery was dead again.  We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work.  We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start.  Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?

We haven't tried the outlet power, so I have no idea how reliable that is.

I won't count on this machine.  Luckily I have a small battery charger that I can plug my car into, and after twenty minutes or so I'm ready to go.  I won't be getting rid of that charger--it's much more dependable
</review_text><review_text>
Appears to be a good product with one major exception. You can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. Required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. The blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. Got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find. 
I find it unbelievable that any company producing this item would not include 4 feet of cheap cord so the product could be put in service at once

This Laser Garage Park was easy to install and works really well. I would recommend this to any one looking for a practical
way to avoid damage to their car while trying to park in the
garage.

I purchased the set of two Park Smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door. But even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again. I may say the service I got through amazon.com was first rate; it's the product I found wanting

We bought this scratch remover years ago from an auto store. It wasn't that expensive but totally useless. We put it on a scratch or two on our car which is black and did what it said. It did nothing except leave a white stain on the area I applied it to. I tried everything to get it off, then I had to use my last option rubbing compound. 

Luckily the rubbing compound got the stain off. After this I dumped the tube in our basement and lost track of it since then (Probably dumped it). Shortly after we went to the auto store again and we found auto paint. They come in a little tube with a paint brush and each paint has a code (got to get the one for your model car). Used it worked well and years later still looks good.

 Up close you can still see a scratch was there but only really up close. After that I waxed the area after the paint dried and it looked fine. Unless you look for it you will not see a scratch. So don't buy this product either buy the auto paint or take your car to an auto body shop. This product would be better as a door stop and even then it would probably do a poor job.

The description of this product is NOT accurate.  These lights are NOT bright.  I have 6 mounted under the cabinets in my very small kitchen and all 6 on at once add up to the equivalent of a night light.  It is a pretty color of light, but very dim
</review_text><review_text>
We were trying to get rid of the wires for under the cabinet lighting.  However, the LED lights were definitely NOT sufficient for this area.  We were very disappointed even after trying to double the number recommended in an area

Installed my bulldog 2030! It's is a total piece of junk.It only works when you tap on the hood. You can pound on the back of the car and nothing. Put the sensor at max, still nothing! This is more of a novelty not an alarm.Its a freaking joke! Don't waste your money

I was unsure about this company so I only popped for a week subscription, felt the gamble of $10 was worth it.  Well not all gambles work out, this one did not.  When you 1st register you tell them what vehicle you have, now one might think once you do this that the information you want to access will be about your particular vehicle, not so.  I want to know how to replace a certain part, well you go to that part look it up, it tells you the replacement procedure for a car not even yours, and nothing about your car, uh!! C'mon. 

There's very little trobleshooting, no flow charts for troubleshooting.
Save you money and buy a Haynes Manual for your vehicle, you'll be much farther ahead.

This car seat cushion's foam padding is not only paper thin, but it also has what feels like circular metal inserts (I'm not kidding) placed in some of the cushion's "massaging bubbles".  This makes for an unbelievably uncomfortable car seat, as these internal metalic objects dig right into your back and spine!  I threw my "Massage Cushion" into the trash after about twenty minutes with this thing

We purchased this rooftop cargo carrier to transport our suitcases and beach items during our summer vacation to New England.  We were initially concerned because it was so inexpensive for the size and worried that it might not fit a Trailblazer.  Upon arrival we were pleased to find that it not only fit securely, but was rather stylish too.  Although it appeared weatherproof we soon found that it was not.  It began raining at the onset of our trip.  About four hours in to our fourteen hour roadtrip the weatherproof lining began disintingrating.  By the time we arrived at our destination all our possessions were soaked and coated in tiny grey vinyl flecks.  This cargo hauler might be cheap and look nice, but it is not worth your money

One day when it was 100 degrees outside, I used it in my car, rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop.  When I came out and got into my car, it was hotter than I could have ever imagined.  It hadn't cooled my car prior to that either.  It looked like a very small fan blowing, and that was it.  I came home, took it off, and threw it out.  I was not satisfied at all
</review_text><review_text>
This includes a big piece of gooey tape to seal the window of your car when using this item--who's actually going to put this on their car? It makes the whole product useless and basically something to throw away. Check the picture--see anything messy you have to stick onto your car? Misleading and a waste of money. Don't buy it

A tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well. That is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire. My Accugage was reading 5 PSI high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer. That's why I give it only one star

I had this alarm professionally installed by PepBoys (which is DesignTech's recommended professional installer). After the initial installation with all the wiring was done, PepBoys found out that the brain was defective. They confirmed this as well with several tests that they did. After being on the phone with DesignTech's horrible customer service, and several faxes later, they sent me a new brain, and I just mailed out the defective old brain with a prepaid mailing label that they provided. After my 2nd visit with PepBoys, it was the same problem. And yes, DesignTech sent me a defective replacement. Several more calls and faxes later, I got the 3rd one, and that one turned out ok.

The features worked fine, and the batteries lasted me a long time. But the fob themselves are made up of really cheap looking plastic (even the silver one). Other than that, it worked fine. I got a new truck, and this time I've invested in an AudioVox system (sold under the Pursuit brand) and I love that everything is so integrated and easier to upgrade. I still had a professional install it and I've never had any problems with it.

EASY AND CLEAR STEPS TO FOLLOW IN INSTALLATION, ALTHOUGH THE UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS REALLY BAD, FEELS VERY CHEAP...TACHLESS MODE WORKS GREAT, BUT FINDING SERVICE AND TECH SUPPORT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE...GOOD LUCK CONTACTING THEM
</review_text><review_text>
The Design Tech Deluxe Remote Car Starter comes with excellent features and a compact remote.  The problem is, the item I received did not work.

All wires were hooked up appropriately and double check with a test kit.  Once hooked up, there was no response from the unit.  After hours of attempting to troubleshoot, I looked online at Design Tech's website for local authorized installers in the hopes that they might be able to answer my question.

Unfortunately the three "authorized" installers in my area REFUSED to touch Design Tech's equipment because, and I quote "they're too difficult to work with.  We haven't had much success."  

A little alarmed by this response, I attempted to contact the company using their 800 number during their live tech support hours.  After waiting 1/2 on hold with no approximate wait time and no end in sight, I hung up and decided instead to return the defective unit back

This item performed as expected, reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with OBD-II connector. Easy to use - only 2 buttons! You might be able to find it $10 cheaper at a local store on sale, but even at the price I paid it was a BARGAIN! Cost of tool = 1 diagnostic visit to local shop
</review_text><review_text>
This OBDII reader is way too simple. Doesn't really do much in diagnostic. Could not reset anything. Save up and buy a bit more better unit

I put the Sunforce 50012 inside my car's windscreen and plugged it into the cigar lighter.  (On this car the cigar lighter is "live" even when the ignition is off).  The Sunforce 50012 worked for one day.  Next day it appeared dead (There is blue LED that blinks when it is working).  I picked it up, it started working, sat it down, it quite.  Twisted it, it worked, then it didn't, then it did.  The old intermitant (sp) connection problem.  Basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it.  Long story short, I fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components.  I am smart and lucky with nothing better to do.  99.999% of the users could not make this fix.  So just forget about it.  This thing is garbage

It took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi.  Truck Air? -- It could barely fill a car tire.  It would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it.  STAY CLEAR. 
</review_text><review_text>
We received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it.  Not only does it not fill anything pass 15 PSI, the 12V cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig. lighter.  The plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out.  With the few more times we used it, I the tip completely broke.  At least it comes with 7 year warranty.  Save yourself the disapointment and headache

We live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car. We bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than Amazon (think a auto store). Anyway we did what it said and did it several times. It did take some of the ding out but not all of it. We barely got the glue off from it. A few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect. Sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. I also watched Fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either. I know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there. Don't buy this product it is worthless.

I work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke.... with the money that you pay for a filter and 5+ qts. of oil, you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up. Will this company stand by its product like that? I doubt it... For a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you're worried about gunk... It's a scam..
</review_text><review_text>
The oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. And the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil. 

Maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? A small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil.
</review_text><review_text>
gimmick.
There are a number of rerouting oil change kits available. Why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail? The oil filter seals itself very well on most engines. While it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles, I wouldn't risk hose failure for a little convenience. On my Toyota truck I discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter. I'm not sure that many people even change their own oil. It's cheaper to take it to the Toyota dealer, 29.95 and they even rotate the tires.
</review_text><review_text>
Sediment and metal particles settle in the bottom of your drain pan and these kits can't siphon all that out.  Most "quickie-lube" stations that pioneered this process have abandoned it because they were getting sued for damaging the engine.  

The right way to change your oil is to run your engine until hot and and drain from the bottom; that does a much better job of removing the sludge

I purchased two of these, both coffee makers arrived without an instruction manual, not that you really need one.   The outside of the box says have coffee in a few minutes, I guess it depends who defines a few minutes.   Both makers took 20 minutes to heat just one cup of water.  To make a pot, that would be 100 minutes.   I am returning as I am definitely disappointed

I own a black '02 Jetta TDI and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. I'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. The NXT Gen Tech Wax isn't one of them. One requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. The NXT box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. In that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. But the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. I waxed my car with NXT, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. I went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. The sun was shining, and as soon as I walked outside and looked at my car, I could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. I did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. I borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. When I got back home, I used alchol to remove the NXT, returned the NXT to the store, got some Eagle One Nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. Good riddance to NXT

This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.

This product preys on the paranoia created by sensationalist newscasts and talk shows.  TV convinces you there's a real chance you might find yourself underwater in your car, and now whoever manufactures this makes a killing.  I'll put it in a drawer with my SARS facemask, my whole life insurance policy, and that replacement plan Best Buy just tried to sell me on a twenty-dollar pair of headphones.  I'm sure this thing works as advertised, and I'm just as sure you'll never need to find out.

Having read reviews that the fluorescent bulb was dim, I was careful to purchase the LED model.  However, it is also dim.  Barely produces enough light to keep me from tripping in my shed, not enough to distinguish tools and definitely not a work light.  Very disappointing.  After several days of charging I turned it on and only 4 of the 5 LEDs lit.  I did not purchase from Amazon.  Went in round and round discussions with retailer and manufacturer about warranty replacement.  Retailer would only replace if whole unit returned within 30 days, but after all the trouble to mount solar panel on roof I didn't want to take that down.  Turns out there is no warranty.  Product guide says to consult retailer for warranty service, retailer says they don't do it.  Finally got a replacement but was not refunded shipping and insurance.  If you do purchase this product, my advice is to charge it up before mounting anything to test it
</review_text><review_text>
after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed, in plain view of the sun, the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again. After the effort I put in carefully mounting the unit I'm very disappointed and don't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work.
</review_text><review_text>
Forget using this in a shed as the light is hardly bright enough to see your hand in front of your face.  

It doesn't hold a charge for longer than a few hours (the unit I received stayed on for about one hour and the box stated three hours).  This information was no where to be found on the website.

I purchased this item to use in my chicken coop and had anticipated that I would be able to leave it turned on at all times.  My plan was that it would recharge during the day and stay illuminated during the night.  Not possible with this unit as it can't charge the battery at all if it's left turned on.  In addition the unit I received had been previously used and returned by someone else (obvious from the packaging that it had been used before)... so I'm not the only one who thought this was worthless.

Save your money and try a different product

I was looking for something like this for months.  It was a new product on Amazon when I did a Froogle search.  Installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when I turned on the light I was disappointed.  My 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. Not much more light than what my lawn lights put out.  During the past two months I've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time.  After being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died.  I haven't even begun to look for a new one.  Very disappointe
</review_text><review_text>
When the factory-charged batteries ran out the solar panel would not charge the light.  This was a fluorescent version.  The replacement unit- quickly sent by Amazon -was LED.  The same case and everything but with bright LEDs inside.  I liked it much better than the fluorescent one.    
The second unit charged and worked very well until the charge was depleted.  Then the LEDs would start blinking.  Like an emergency light.  Sunforce said that this was not normal behavior.  I returned it as well.  The light will stay up for around two hours, charge quickly but the blinking made it unfit for continuous use.  A nice product but quallity needs to be improved

We were expecting MORE of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving.  It would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling.  As for "king size" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it..

This product works great for draining your car's crankcase oil. It has a screen to catch the drain plug. HOWEVER, the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a PIECE OF CRAP. You are supposed to tighten it down, then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal. The large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half-inch too far makes no seal at all. It falls off when you tip the unit to drain, emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor. This is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well

I suggest that you do a search on this product on infomercial scams dot com.

Take a look at this review from Channel 2 (KDKA) in Pittsburgh, PA:

You've probably seen the ad on TV for auto cool - it's supposed to keep your parked car cooler.

But does it really do that? 

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to keep your parked car cool?

Diane Black knows all too well the misery of climbing into a hot car. 

"I am a visiting nurse. I'm in and out of the car all day," Black said. "I hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. So I thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing."

After shipping and handling, $23 for Auto Cool as seen on TV. 

The same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car. 

But does it really do that?

On a hot day last week, we decided to find out. Inside the Auto Cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping.

The only thing you need is a pair of scissors.

Now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun.

We choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches.

The solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. No problem there. We hang it on the window, fan side in.

Next comes the weather stripping.

So we've installed Auto Cool. Now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees.

While we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction.

One hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car.

We are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. It just got hotter inside. 

But just to be fair, we test one more car.

We make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. This time, it's 80 degrees.

We quickly install auto cool. By now, the temperature is 90 degrees. 

While Diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. She says it will take about 20 minutes. 

In the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car.

Will it work this time? 

Twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees.

Maybe if we hadn't used Auto Cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care. 

Not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far.

Don't waste your money on this one.

If you, like myself, live in world where there is "weather", then you'll understand why I hate this product.  You see, there are times when the temperature of my car, and everything in it, becomes amazingly cold.  We call it "winter".  You've never heard of it, you say? Well, apparently neither have the people who dreamed up this stuff.  I've had a can of this in my car for over a year now.  Went out to my car one FREEZING morning (it gets like that during the "winter" I mentioned before), and saw I had a flat!  "No problem" thinks I, "I do believe I have been carrying a solution to this very problem right here in the trunk!".  Open the trunk, pull out the "Fix a Flat" (HA!) only to find it FROZEN SOLID.  Now, what use does something like this have, whereby you keep it in your car for an emergency only to have it completely useless when you need it most!?  Cost me time + $ to put on my spare, haul it to a shop, and have my tire repaired.  This stuff was a waste of money. If you live somewhere where there's actual WEATHER, don't kid yourself with this nonsense

this product does work, BUT it has to face the sun, so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning, not in the afternoon, it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the TV ad.
Also they are hard to place with powered windows
</review_text><review_text>
This device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT SAYS IT DOES.  The unit is hard to install, for beginners. It is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather. If there is low sunlight, or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows, even factory shading, IT DOES NOT WORK. You must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it, and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun??
</review_text><review_text>
This product does not cool down the car.  It is too small.  I would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks.  If you buy this, PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PETS OR KIDS IN THE CAR and think that it is safe

Installation of these blades is not straightforward--three adapter pieces and a pin are included, which might work well enough, but the instructions provided with the product could not be more of a joke. I'll be returning to the store and asking one of their employees (at Kragen) to install all three blades (they're nice enough there, if you're willing to wait). In the future, I won't be buying this product when I need new blades. I don't mind a bit of complication in installing stuff like this, but the instructions should be adequate to the task, and they're really not

The reasons that I bought this charger is because it has a docking stations which can be used to charge and store the unit when not in use. After the charging is completed, the docking station will enter a "floating charge" mode to prevent overcharging. Some other charger need to be monitored carefully since overcharging can damage the battery. With this unit, I can just leave it and forget it... Also, this unit is small enough that my wife can use it to jumpstart her minivan. Some other multifunction charger are so heavy, you'd have to be a weightlifter to carry the thing.

I use this as an alternate 12V power source to power a 12V
air compressor and it is a great product! It can power a
Spot Light(15 watts/12V) for 12 hours. So it doesn't have a problem at all when I blow up tires, floats etc.

I'm really surprised at the negative reviews on these wipers. I bought two pairs of wipers just over a year ago, expecting I'd have the second pair as backup. I haven't needed the second pair - the first pair are still just like new - they don't squeak, chatter, or smear and are great for visibility. I live in Seattle, so it's not like I never use them either - we've been deluged by rain in the last year!

The only thing I can think is that maybe others are mistreating their wiper blades. Keep your windshield clean, and if the wipers are smearing, just wipe the cleaning edge off with a paper towel from time to time. That's not a problem with the blade, that's a problem with the cleanliness of your windshield and blade. Any wiper blade struggles when it's bogged down with dirt, pollen, and road grime.

I figure eventually I'll use my backup pair, but until then I'm happy
</review_text><review_text>
Worth the price as my window is ALWAYS clean. Just for a comparison I leave a new but lesser quality wiper on the passenger side. The difference is incredible.
</review_text><review_text>
These are great blades, installation is very straight forward.  The only gripe I have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1/2", but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke.  But it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars.  I guess there are no replacement for factory blades

You do NOT need to remove the adhesived back, despite the commentary by another "reviewer" -- the instructions explain how you can just take off the top portion to replace the batteries.

It is not a blindingly effective light, but it does work. The Dot-Its were recommend to us by folks on the Scion xb boards -- the light in the interior isn't suffcient. The Dot-Its work very well and fit nicely throughout dark spots. The adhesive is very strong.

I hooked up a small 20 watt Solar System at my home. Bought this Sunforce 60012 7 amp Charge Controller and everything worked Great. The LED came on and the controller sent the power to the battery even in low cloudy days with no sun.  I saw some hype online about MorningStar's 'SunGuard SG-4' (&amp; it's PWM) and it's fancy line graph showing how it was far superior to other controllers. Bought one for $27.oo and $11.oo shipping tacked on from another vendor), swapped it out with this SUNFORCE 60012 Controller hoping for a big improvement. Waited for morning... and put my volt meter on the system only to find the SunGuard SG-4 (with NO LED) was still sound asleep! Zero volts passing through it! So I immediately removed the SunGuard SG-4 and re-installed the SUNFORCE 60012 Charge Controller I purchased here from Amazon. Poof... back to producing 12 Volts from my solar panels and the hazy sky had no sign of sun. The SunGuard SG-4 is now on it's way to the local landfill... and the SUNFORCE 60012 has a permanent home in my home solar power system. Sunforce's LED is glowing and the Solar 12 Volts are flowing to my battery again. Stick with the SUNFORCE 60012 it is far superior and WORKS like it's supposed to. Call me old-fashioned... I think that's why I bought the SUNFORCE (&amp; the 'SunGuard SG-4' ~ 4 amp w/ No LED )in the first place? # SUNFORCE 60012 7 amp Charge Controller #: Low price and High Quality and it actually does what it's supposed to do! "Go figure..." :-) 5 STARS!

I am not trying for a show quality shine, just a nice clean car and drying with spots was always the issue for me outside the $6 wash. 

I liked this. I washed and watched dry two cars and a motorcycle in just the time it took to wet, wipe with soap, and rinse with the no spot setting. Worked great for the price.

I use this system on the outside of the windows of our home and love it.  I picked up a long handled sheepskin window washing tool and love the whole system.  Must do the windows when the sun is NOT  on them.  It has worked great now for two years. Inside of windows shine if you use a window cleaner and newspapers.  I thought the newspapers would not absorb the cleaner--but they work great.  Hope you find this as useful as I have.  Bluekitt

i think the people who give one stars aren't following the directions...wash your car at sunset and it dries perfectly (even in texas)...i don't think it really matters how you wash it; using the filtered water and not drying the car in the sun is what gives you no streaks or spots...the only problem i have is that it uses more soap than stated on the product...also the filter doesn't as long as i would like...this might be 'cause i was washing a van and not a smaller vehicle..
</review_text><review_text>
Simplifies car washing, as soap and water are contained in the easy to use sprayer. The best thing is the finish...eliminates the need for drying with chamois, etc. and leaves a streak-free spotless finish, especially on windows. I'm happy with it
</review_text><review_text>
I was a bit skeptical about buying this product because of the other products I have tried that claimed to be spot-free and failed   miserably.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Mr. Clean AutoDry system!  If you follow the directions and put a bit of effort into your wash job it works very, very good!

- You first rinse off your vehicle with regular, unfiltered water either through the AutoDry gun or with your regular hose sprayer.

- Next, you use the AutoDry on the "soap" setting and completely cover the vehicle.  They advise to only use the Mr. Clean soap, of course, because it contains agents not normally found in other car washing soap that assists in the sheeting action (similar to Jet Dry for the dishwasher)

- Thirdly, you give the vehicle an old fashioned hand wash with a sponge.  Make sure you do a good job and clean it completely or you will find streaks when it dries with the old dirty water smeared all over.

- Fourth, rinse the vehicle completely with unfiltered water.  Make sure you are very through in this stage.  Take your time!

- Finally, set the AutoDry to the filtered rinse setting and go over the vehicle again.  Make sure you start at the vehicle's highest point to remove all the tap water sitting on the roof.  Basically, you want the filtered water to remove all the unfiltered water.  Spray the filtered water in all the crevices to avoid spots later (side view mirrors, bumpers, etc.)

Although it sounds like it takes a long time it is really quite quick if you put some effort into it.  I can do a complete vehicle (Ford Explorer) start to finish in about 15 minutes.  The car dries completely spot free EVERY time!  Of course, the results will only be as good as YOU make them.  If you don't wash completely or rinse the unfiltered water off completely there WILL be spots.  It is up to you to do a through job to get great results

The Organizer works well for keeping disparate shopping items from rolling around in the back of the car.  I do wish the partitions were actually attachable by velcro to the organizer and soft.  The hard plastic partitions is this Organizer are simply square plates that can be stuck in between items.  I tend to not use them since they don't even work to soften the bumps between jossling items. My husband's trunk organizer (which I didn't buy because it cost 3x as much) has the softer, attachable partitions.  I guess that would be worth the money in retrospect for MY needs.  But in all this is great for the price. Now I get to the office, or home, and easily carry everything in at once to unload

What is missing is that the product gets free refills from Zymol for life.  So, if you use a lot of high-end wax then this will pay for itself in a few years.

And, yes, Zymol makes the best wax I've ever used

I hope the person reviewing above is joking because it is not a body hair removal wax, it is for automobiles. The high percentage of white carnuba which is what it is made with provides an intense luster to the car paint

The desert gets really dusty, so having this product to swipe over my car (especially windows) helps me save money on car washes. I wish the package had included a bigger cover to store the brush in. It's awkward putting it back into the same cover it came in, once you start accumulating dirt.
</review_text><review_text>
Although I have not tried other models of the California duster, I really like this design. Since this model has dusting tassles all the way around, you simple rotate the duster after each wipe. This will ensure that the dust you capture does not build up in any one spot. This design also works well for dusting the underside of my car's spoiler.

The duster really does capture dust and not just push it around. My only complaint is that the re-usable storage bag should be larger than it is to make it easier to get the duster back into it.

I was sold on these back in 1999 when I saw a man dusting his $15,000 black paint job on a hot rod at a car show.  I was at first shocked to see him running it over the paint and asked him about scratching the paint.  He said he would use nothing else to get light dust and pollen of his cars and the proof was there to see.  My last one "died" the other day after 5 years of almost daily use when a defective bleach bottle spilled in my trunk after grocery shopping.  I am ordering another one today.  I've used these on many different cars and colors - including black and have never had problems.  This is truly a bargain even at twice the Amazon price

Have always used the regular California Duster.  Time to replace the one I have had for years.  Thought I would try the Extra Large duster.

The Super Duster has been very efficient in removing dust off my new 2005 Camry XLE and keeping her shiny between washes. Along with trimming car wash expenses, the full knitting minimizes twists of the wrist inherent with one-sided dusters to keep upright.

I like to think of my self as a responsible driver but when I get a ticket for going over 10mph I get really ticked off.  I searched trough the internet trying to find a solution for these ridicules tickets and I found the reflector cover.  This stuff is amazing, I have seen a flash go off while I pass trough speed camera.  It's been almost 2 months and I still didn't get any ticket.  I think everyone should protect themselves with the reflector cover because the cameras are there to collect revenue instead of protecting the public

I recently bought a pair of the reflector cover from photoblocker store on Amazon.

They told the system had problems and they would fix it. Well I put a stop to it when I ordered 2 reflectors for my cars. I have not had any tickets in the mail since. I love this product. It is so simple and yet effective. Everyone should get it. The best $50 I have spent lately

I've never used any other type of oil filter wrench or strap but this tool worked for me when I couldn't twist off an oil filter by hand.  It uses a 3/8" drive but it doesn't "snap" onto the wrench so it can fall off easily.  As long as you are careful, you shouldn't have a problem and it will save you a lot of time when changing your oil filter.

The prongs can be adjusted by holding onto the "base" and turning the socket with a wrench.  The prongs rotate around the base depending on the direction you turn.  The way it works is that at the widest position, turning in either direction will cause the prongs to "close in" on a certain direction.  That way, as long as you have the prongs closing in on the proper direction, when you are trying to remove an oil filter, it will grip harder as you turn counter-clockwise.  If you have the prongs closing in on the wrong direction, then turning counter-clockwise will actually widen the prongs

The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.

I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat.

This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car, or for someone who likes doing their own detailing

I show Mustangs and dirt/lint/dust can really impact a judge.  This little thing works wonders and it's bigger brother keeps your car clean and dust free.

Initially, it will leave a bit of streaking on dark paint as the waxy substance that grabs dirt can come off a bit, but as you use it--and it gets dirtier--it works better and better.  The streaks easily come off with a quick spritz of detail spray.

Get this.  Use it.  You'll love it.  And get the large one for your outside.

Trust me.  It's that good

I am extremely happy with this quality AAA Vehicle Emergency Kit from Auto Barn.  It has everything a stranded traveller would need except water, food, blankets and a quarter for a pay phone.  My biggest dread in purchasing an all inclusive car kit is getting a cheap compressor, cheap jumper cables and a cheap flashlight.  Cables are a thick enough (8 guage) and long enough--10 feet.  The compressor seems solid and is rated at 250 psi.  The flashlight is rubber-encased with a good quality O-ring to keep moisture out of the body, and batteries are included.  All this with basic tools comes in a well-organized, attractive and durable carrying case. I ordered a competitor's product and CHEAP EVERYTHING is what I got--half the price but it was all WORTHLESS JUNK.  Not so with this kit from Auto Barn and AAA.  This is an excellent kit and an outstanding buy that I am happy to recommend.

I have had this awesome little device for about 5 years now.  In that time there have been TWO attempts by car thieves to take my car (a Honda Civic).  

The first attempt it looks as though they saw it and moved on (door was open, things shuffled about).  This was while it was parked at my school in the midst of a string of Honda Civic thefts (there had been no less than 10 thefts of modified civics in the past two months--which is what inspired me to buy this).  Given the context of the situation and since nothing else was taken or disturbed, the only logical conclusion is that they were after the car itself.

The second attempt was by a much more aggressive would-be thief.  This one worked at the clutch lock for a good long time.  When I got to my car the next morning, the clutch pedal covering was broken off and the pedal bar itself was bent slightly off to the right, however the lock remained solidly in place.  They even broke into my trunk to retrieve the tools to try and pry it off.  They had no such luck.  The pedal cover was replaced for $10 and all was well.

I would trust any car to this in any situation.  Certainly you should use an alarm as well, and be conscious about where you leave your car, but this is a fantastic deterrent.

This product is the best 60 bucks I have ever spent on my car.  GET IT

I have degenerative disc disease, and am in chronic pain. This back support seat cushion is the finest there is for supporting your back while sitting anywhere. It is odd to find it under auto supplies, when I think it should be under health supplies. I am purchasing my second one for my office. My first one sits at the dining room table always. If I did a lot of driving, I might also use it - however my car seat seems designed for back comfort on its' own. There is no way to explain HOW this forme supports your lower back while sitting, but it does just radiate comfort because of its' shape. I can only say - get one! Carol D

I've had it for about a month now and I finally got to use it yesterday.  I was so impressed by how easy it was to use and how fast it worked.  To be honest, I hate dealing with anything under the hood of my car but even in my incapable hands, this thing could not have been any easier to use.  Best of all, it started my car instantly.  I was so proud of myself!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  And as others have mentioned, it has sturdy metal clamps that look like they would very difficult to break.  The whole thing looks solidly built.

Perhaps Black and Decker got a lot of complaints about an earlier edition of this item-- but I should note first that the one I received today has nice, heavy metal clamps.

Haven't used it yet but I'm confident it will work well. I'm very impressed by the apparent high quality of construction and fit and finish, as well as design.

Frankly, I think it would be a good value at the $49.99 Amazon lists as the retail price-- but of course Amazon's price with free shipping is that much better

I have a Honda, which I love, but since I do not drive her on a daily basis now, the battery is tempermental. I bought this product and have had to use it several times. I've found it easy to use and, even when the car battery has been completely dead, this jumpstarter has had more than enough power to get her started. I comparison shopped and the price of this Black &amp; Decker was the best bargain, too. Recommend it highly

Unit appears to be solidly constructed.  Maybe I lucked out and got an upgraded version, but there have been a couple of reviewers that said the the plastic clamps snapped.  The unit I have (manufactured 11/06) has ALL METAL clamps, very much nicer than many regular standard jumper cables.

 

This unit will hold a charge but needs to be maintained (recharged) at least every 60 days or so. 

 

NEVER charge via the cigarette lighter adapter in your vehicle longer than 3-4 hours.  It may be left on AC charge indefinately.  It is better to keep it fully charged, discharging this unit will result in shorted cells.

 

All in all, a very small price to pay for peace of mind, at home and on the road.  With a power inverter (less than $20.00) you can have silent power source for lights, cell phones, small tv's, laptops, flourescent lights, etc.

T. Dorau -- when properly stored, what you complain about will never happen.  A battery should -never- be stored in sub-zero or near-freezing temperatures.  Don't leave it in the garage!

This unit offers "quick" recharging (4 to 5 hours) from a 12V source or gradual recharging (12 to 24 hours) from an AC source.

The AC source may be left connected indefinitely (true "float" charging) which is a plus for a standby power source.  The inclusion of the LED light source is very thoughtful on the part of the designer(s).

In addition to jump starting a car, this is a good choice for small household items (TV, Radio, Weather Alert Radio) or emergency communications equipment (CB, Ham Radio).

This product also appears in some stores under the "Husky" and "Vector" brand-names

I'm using this product to power a small electric trolling motor that I use as emergency power for my small inflatable sailboat.  For that purpose, it is performing well -- giving me the 30 minute usage per unit that I thought it would.  I would like a better indication of how much charge is left in the battery.  The three lights (low, medium, high) are OK but not as accurate an indicator as I think a meter or more lights would have been.   I like the 12V outlet to power accesories in the boat.  I do not need the DC-to-DC charging option. Charge time has been good.  Maybe this winter I'll keep a charged unit in my vehicle and actually use the unit for its intended purpose.

This gauge works well and is easy to read. It seats well and does mostly what it should.
There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what I have read in other reviews. Let's clear a few things up.
First of all, you do NOT have to wait ten seconds between readings. You DO have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings.
Secondly, you DO NOT have to send the unit back to replace the batteries. The instructions VERY clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries (if you were to read the instructions).
The hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what I have read elsewhere. Maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then I use mine in the garage.

Very Nice Gauge
</review_text><review_text>
I wanted a digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed to be more accurate than the stick models. This gauge comes with instructions and is fairly easy to use. My favorite part of this gauge is the bleed valve. With other gauges, you have to put in air, then check the gauge, put in air, check it again. With this gauge, you can overinflate your tires a little bit, then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired PSI.

Assuming this lasts a long time, I would recommend it to everyone

Jan. 21 Update:  I got the low-battery indication while using the gauge, and it turns out that the LR1130 batteries are alkaline, not lithium as both the product packaging and instructions say they are.  The batteries are indeed very easily replaced, and I'm replacing them with the silver oxide equivalent (SR1130W), as the original batteries apparently weren't the freshest (although they were Hitachi-Maxell).  I continue to like this gauge very much.

I think this is a great product at a great price (currently $35 total), and I just bought a 2nd one to lend so others can see for themselves (don't want to be without mine in case it doesn't come back).

Very simple to connect and take a reading, and when bleeding air the numbers drop with the drop in air pressure, so I can reach the exact pressure I want quickly.  The batteries are user replaceable, but they are lithium (LR1130) and are expected to last more than several years (the packaging suggests they will last the life of the gauge, as "permanent power").  The gauge can be zeroed (recalibrated) simply by turning it on without any air pressure in the hose, confirming that the display reads "0.0," and waiting until the display goes off (20 sec. when no pressure is present and 60 sec. when there is pressure present).

While the gauge display reads to a tenth of a pound, the actual stated accuracy in the instructions is plus or minus 1 percent plus 0.5 PSI, which suggests that the real accuracy is within about 0.2 to 0.8 pound, which is still better than any other gauge I've seen or used.

The instructions explain things well enough (they read as though they were translated into English, but still completely understandable), and the listed Web site for the actual manufacturer, Measurement Ltd., Inc. (in New Jersey), provides contact info. for user inquiries.

I like using this gauge (it's quick and easy), and that makes maintaining my tire pressure at the proper level simple to do consistently (along with a good portable air compressor, like the TyphoonMax TX-500, which I also really like).

this cover worked great - kept the windshield dry &amp; ice free during the last snowstorm

This is my second item of this type, and in the wintertime it is indepensible. With no garage to keep my SUV in, this cover fills the void. It is easy to put on, just takes a few minutes, and saves many minutes of scraping ice the next morning! This particular one is large enough for my SUV with some room to spare

I have used these to change the oil on my 2006 Chevy Silverado 4x4.  They work like a champ.  There is plenty of room underneath.  They seem very sturdy.  My only complaint is - my truck kept moving the ramps.  I had to put it in 4 wheel drive to get up them.  This should not be an issue with a front wheel drive.  I also have a 2001 Nissan Maxima.  The ramps fit under the air dam nicely on the Nissan.  I will use these for that vehicle also.  One last note:  The name implies these ramps can hold 12,000 lbs.  This is not the case.  They are actually rated at 3,000 lbs each.  This is plenty of capacity for my full size truck, and for any car I know of

Great seller to deal with and the product is the best on the market

I have a 02 Dodge Intrepid plus a 05 Chrysler Pacifica, I was a little hesitant to go under my vehicle's at first but from multiple test try's (Up &amp; Down) you can tell they are built well and can hold the weight. I'm 354lbs and had no problems going under, My Intrepid transmission shifter cable broke and putting a new one on was a breeze thanks to the ramps, I also change my transmission fluid and filter. personally I love the ramps, the fact they are lightweight and strong  makes them a keeper. I'm saving so much money because of the ramps, no more going to the dealership for over priced oil changes (LOL) I saved $200 putting the new shifter cable on my Intrepid. THE RAMPS ARE AWESOME..
</review_text><review_text>
Like the other user I had to use a 1x8 under tires to clear my Honda civic. These ramps made changing oil a breeze.

Now I have to get rid of the old metal ramps
</review_text><review_text>
I have a 06 Corvette and 05 Explorer and I use the ramps for both vehicles oil changes, they work well and seem safe and strong(you should always use jack stands as an additional safety measure).With the Vette, the ramps touch the front air dam but cause no damage(If you are worried about it rubbing, you could use two 1x4's in front of the ramps for additional clearance). The ramps are about 6.25 inches tall where the tire sits and there is plenty of room for me(250lbs)under the Vette. Nice product

Plugged the unit in a few weeks after I purchased it.  I was heading down to VA. for a reunuion (8 hr. trip).  Set it up facing "backwards" so the kids could make use of the cup holders from the middle seats of the minivan.  The unit cooled quickly and kept the sodas, cheese and veggies cool throughout.  The unit is quiet, didn't really know it was running unless I had the engine off.  Could be a little roomier but you can only do so much with the space between the front seats.  Overall got what I paid for and the unit worked as advertised

Works grest and is easy to use.  Keeps me warm in my car since my heater is not so good

I really like using this product because it cuts the drying time of car washing to almost no time at all.  I hate spending a long time drying my car so it is perfect
</review_text><review_text>
I used one of these water-blades at a school car wash and was sold. The parent that brought the water-blade said he had received it as a gift and was really happy with it, used it a lot. It does not remove all the water, you still have some small amounts that will require a towel, but this is a small amount. We used it on 20-30 cars at the car wash to pre-dry the cars before the kids finished the job and it worked great! Purchased one for myself, so I guess that's a good recommendation
</review_text><review_text>
If you wash your car yourself, you should have this.  Once you have the Blade, you only need one small towel for drying edges.  The Blade does all the work for you.  It's fabulous.  My neighbor who washes his car weekly has one and I saw him use it and was amazed at how well it worked.  He said he has owned a Blade for years and gives them as gifts. Then I saw another neighbor using one. I gave them to my husband and adult sons and they love them.  My eight year old also thinks it is now fun to wash the car... THAT is priceless
</review_text><review_text>
We've been using this water blade as a shower squeegee -- it is the most effective tool we've found to remove the water from the walls of our shower. It's large and efficient.
</review_text><review_text>
I just bought one of these for my new car.  IT works soooo nuch faster than a chamois.  I can tell that I will get better at it with more use and with more use the squeegee will take on the shape of the car.  It dried better than the chamois that Iwas using and left no water spots on the car.  I used the rag that came with it for hard to get to spots, but that was a small amount compared to the whole car
</review_text><review_text>
It works great - easily sheeting off water from flat surfaces.  I ALWAYS use this prior to hand-drying my car, because it makes it 5x quicker with most of the water gone from the water blade.  I definitely recommend it
</review_text><review_text>
This are excellent and I can dry my SUV with all three easily.  After a few wrings with each towel they begin to get too wet to dry efficiently.  I definitely recommend it for the DIY car detailers
</review_text><review_text>
I use Meguiar's Supreme Shine Microfiber to dry my car after I wash it. There's no lint and it gives my car an incredible shine. It's also great for windows as well. I will only use this product from now on.
</review_text><review_text>
I bought these not for my car, but to clean stainless steel in my kitchen, wash mirrors, that sort of thing.

I can honestly say I've bought just about every microfiber cloth out there, and none work as well as these. I can clean the stainless in my kitchen in minutes, with no streaks, no lint, just shine, and without using chemicals (just some white vinegar and rubbing alcohol in warm water.) 

I probably added a few years to my life with all the time I've saved with these cloths. I highly recommend them
</review_text><review_text>
That's right!  A quote from Detective Eames on Law &amp; Order:  Criminal Intent.  She and Goren were in a garage and she pointed out a chamois cloth and smelled it and that's when she said, "Meguiar's, the good stuff.  My father used to use it on his ..."
The first time I saw that episode I didn't know what she was talking about.  But I saw it the other day (on Bravo) and I got it!  That's because I have become an avid fan of Meguiar's products since I bought a Mercedes 7 months ago!  
This product I mostly use on the interior.  It is like a magnet for wiping the dash and wood trim.  You hardly need the sprays but they are good too.  Keep one handy in your glove comparment.
It gives a great shine on the outside whey you use it with Meguiar's Quik Detailer Spray. Enjoy

I love them! They are not only cute but practical. The steering wheel cover protects my hands from the hot or cold temperature. This is my first steering wheel protector and I will definitely always have one from now on. This steering wheel cover seems like it will last a very long time. My only concern is how to disinfect it...I wonder if this is machine washable? The license plate frame looks great and so far there's no rust :) Tip...buy this package instead of separately and save some money

Great purchase. If you like to keep your vehicle looking good and don't have a lot of time to wash it when it is only dusty, then this is a great time saver. Takes only minutes and looks like it was just cleaned. Well worth the money.  
</review_text><review_text>
You can trust that this item works well and does not scratch your paint. I was always skeptical previously and just asssumed these things scratched the car. But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me. He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it. 

I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.

I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!

I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle. Just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty. My only complaint is that it is not actually made in Calfornia
</review_text><review_text>
I am a car fanatic and have used one of these dusters on my cars for the last decade or more.  As long as the surface is dry, it works wonderfully.  Once some contaminants start to build on the paint, use the duster, then some Quick Detail with a microfiber cloth to get the paint really clean.  My cars always look new with these things.  I just traded in my 2004 RX-8 after 2.5 years of using the duster, and it still looked absolutely new.  I now use it on my 2006 Lancer Evolution and, again, the car looks brand-new (which it is).  I love them
</review_text><review_text>
I live in a desert climate and I've been using this for 5 years on my Corvette and it works great. I use it daily which allows me to avoid the carwash up to 2 weeks in a good stretch. 

Highly recommended
</review_text><review_text>
I just purchase a Harley Davidson Motorcycle and this is the best product to keep the dust off of it.  I live in the middle of the desert (Ft. Irwin) and I always receive comments on how clean my motorcycle is kept in this enviornment.
I highly recommend this product to anyone who ride a bike and takes pride in the look of his bike
</review_text><review_text>
I first got one of these as a gift back in the late '80s when I bought my first new car. It worked exactly as advertised and in the intervening years, I have replaced it only two or three times... 

It does actually work better once it gets dirtier - I can absolutely attest to this as I got a new one about a year ago, and the older one worked better at first... After a couple weeks (I dust the car about about four times a day), it started to work as well as the older one. I took the old one and tried washing it by hand with cold ater and Woolite, as recommended on the makers website, and it definitely was cleaner and still worked just as well. 

If you love your car even half as much as I do, this product is worth EVERY cent
</review_text><review_text>
Works great ONLY if you have dry dusts. If the dust is wet, or was wet and now dried, it doesn't work. Otherwise, great as a touch up dusting in between washings.
</review_text><review_text>
Well... I bought this duster with a bit of skepticism... having just bought a new car!  It works very well when you literally have a light dusting to remove... which is what I was looking for... for in between car washes
</review_text><review_text>
It is a simple device, and it is easy to imagine enhancements that would improve it, yet it is as advertised and does just what I wanted it to do. It sits in a shallow cardboard box between the seats of my old Nissan where it is perfectly level and will not shift around while I'm driving, so I set it up just before I leave for work. I work close to my home, so my morning commute is about ten minutes, about the time it takes the Wagan to brew my coffee. A larger cup with a brew-through lid would make it safer for use while the car is in motion, which the manufacturer recommends against, still I am very happy with it and have no complaints.
</review_text><review_text>
fast shipping... great product .. very easy to use.. i highly reccomend this product if you dont want to deal with complicated 
wiring and difficult to install alarms. this products works fine and VERY easy to work with
</review_text><review_text>
My car was broken into several months ago, so I decided to buy the wrap. It has worked so well; it is better than other steering wheel binders since it has an alarm on it. 
Much cheaper than other conventional car alarms. A little bulky but it does the job. I really think thieves think twice when they see the huge thig on the steering wheel and the lights for the alarm. I am really glad I got this product here at amazon.co

I received the MV50 for Christams to air up my RAM 1500 Megacab after surf fishing. I gave it a trial run in my driveway today and was very happy. I dropped my front tire down to 15 PSI. The MV50 aired up to 45 PSI in 2 minutes !!! Very cool. With the length of hose and jumper cable attachments I can reach the back right tire as well. You can't beat it for the money
</review_text><review_text>

Compressor provides air at good rate in reasonable time frame. Coiled line provides convenience. AC adapter would be desired addition but there must be a reason it isn't included
</review_text><review_text>
This little machine is capable of pulling so much current, that it would blow most fuses for Cigarette lighters, which is why the adapter isn't included. It needs to be clipped directly to the battery, and is good at filling large truck tires in a couple minutes.
</review_text><review_text>
My MV-50 just arrived tonight and it worked fine, it would have made sense if it had a cigarette adaptor than having to use the battery. The gauge starts off from zero and increments by 5psi, so it is off by 5psi! The gauge reads: 0,5,10,15,20,25. At 20psi, it is showing 25psi.  

The only confusion is what I found on the internet for some people paying only $25 for this and not $70 plus shipping charges.

The connector is not useful for tight spaces, like a rear motorcycle tire on my Yamaha 650 Maxim. 

I think it is going to perform to my racing needs.

</review_text><review_text>
I bought this compressor with the intent of airing my tires back up after a day of 4-wheeling. For this purpose, it works amazingly. It comes with an awesome carrying case, and everything else you would expect with a portable air compressor...it will air up my tires quickly--the specs state about 4 minutes to air up a 35" tire.

When running, the compressor is pretty quiet and doesn't vibrate and bounce around. The built-in gauge is quite accurate once the unit is turned off. 

In short...buy this air compressor if you have ANY use for it at all. It will easily beat compressors which cost over 3 times what this unit does

You don't even need windshield wipers with this, and given the fact that the Arizona sun usually ruins them before needed, this is a very good thing
</review_text><review_text>
Its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking.   Clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off. I dont really buy any of those as seen on TV items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping.  Remember this works best when over about 40mph... and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea

This stuff is the best example I can think of, of a product that not only works but far exceeded my expectations.  As one reviewer mentioned, it will cause wintertime ice to easily flake off.  Ditto for summertime bug removal.  It repels rain so well that it is a viable alternative to doing an expensive windshield wiper mechanism repair (for those of us that drive old cars).  I work as a highway patrolman (er . . patrolperson) for a living, and quickly learned that windshield wipers tend to lift off of the windshield when when having to drive at 80-90+.  No problem with Rain-X as this is where it works best -- aided by the wind to blow your windshield clear.  MANY TIMES I have driven to a call at high speed, in blinding downpour rain, with my wipers turned off and seeing perfectly (and enjoying my coffee), while other traffic is stopped on the shoulder or crowded in under bridge overpasses (I still can't figure out the purpose of that) due to no visibility. And I find that it lasts for several weeks on a car that is not garaged.  My highest recommendation.  Three thumbs up!  Oops - make that two thumbs up
</review_text><review_text>
This is the greateast invention to winter driving I've ever found I have told all my friends and coworkers about this stuff.
I remember an Ice,sleet storm of early 05 I sprayed this on the

purchase this item.If the scale to rate this item went any higer
I'd give it as high as a 10.Please I recomend this for any winter driver HIGHLY

I love Rain-X.  The rain literally beads up and rolls right off your windshield.  It keeps my windshield nice and clean.  It's almost like you don't even have to put on your wipers when you're driving and there's a light rain

First of all '11 cubic feet' means a little for me so if you were wondering about the dimesions of this bag, look no further (because nor even in lund's web site you could find this valuable information). The dimensions labeled in the box are 44"x36"x16" (l,w,h). So far I stuffed it with six letter size stackable white cardboard boxes like those you find at Office Depot (15.5"x12.5"x11") intended for your backlog (by Willamette), it's not easy at first glance but, believe it or not, there's enough room for them. Te curb of the aerodinamic shape ends some 18" from the front side to the back to reach the 16" claimed. For me it seems like a parabolic shape because the height continues to increase slightly up to around 18" in the backside. With my 6 backlog boxes in place there's still some 26"x36"x5" of room above them.

Material seems to be strong, the only think I don't like is the zipper wich seems to be regular one not one intended to support strong wind force. Well, in two weeks I'll tell you what happened with this bag during my 600 mile trip. 

So far, so good

The helmet fits snug on my head.  No complaints about its styling. There is only one complaint.  I purchased this helmet because I heard the horror stories of people saying there helmet would fog up.  This helmet stated that it was an anti fog helmet.  Not true.  I still have to pull the shield up, or pull the helmet up.  Other than that its a great helmet

Take care because if not you can lose much air triying to know the preassure of the tire
</review_text><review_text>
I received it, charged it up, and went out and used it to crank up my lawnmower that had been sitting up all winter. She cranked right up. A friend borrowed it to crank up his KIA. The battery was dead. The KIA cranked right up without any problems. Excellent.

The only draw back is that the positive and negative leads are very short (thus, 4 stars). When I jump a car battery I like to hook the negative lead up away from the battery to avoid spraks and a possible explosion from battery fumes. (It happens and a battery post flying through the air can mess up your day.) This can't be done with the Mity-Mite because (again) the leads are too short.

For the price this product is an excellent value. It does what it says it will do. Apart from the short leads, what more could you ask for? 
</review_text><review_text>
I've been using a Mity-Mite for three years and have never had a problem until now.  It won't charge.  I've used it to jump my Toyota Tundra (V8) and Honda Civic when the batteries were deader than rocks.  I've also jumped my riding mower, which is an accomplishment in itself since the stupid seat has to be down (on top of the battery - jumpers and all) to get it to start. Hopefully, my next Mity-Mite will work as well.  I wish it had an attachment to blow up tires
</review_text><review_text>
great item at a great price... I bought two for a bit more than one at local stores..
</review_text><review_text>
Despite its size, this product works wonderfully! I have already used it multiple times to start my SUV on days when the weather has dipped below zero, and it's worked every time.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced Jump Starter
</review_text><review_text>
My "trusty" Ford Escort experienced cold shock when moved from TX to PA in December. It needed to be jump started -- the jump starter has been extremely easy and effective to use
</review_text><review_text>
PROS: Inexpensive, compact and thoughtfully designed.

CONS: No DC adapter, although there is a hole for an ad-on connector. no power cord and you need an extension cord to to fit in the recessed A/C port.

RECOMMEND: Yes!

PAID: $19.00 ON Summer closeout

COMMENTS: I bought this to jump start my 1 ton Dodge RV after Winter storage. I've jumpped my 1997 GMC Suburban and various other cars/trucks and it performed flawlessly and I live in an area where sub-zero temps are the norm during Fall and Winter.
 It is not a flashlight, warning light, battery charger, air compressor or DC converter! But IT IS a decent jump starter at an affordable price!
</review_text><review_text>
This device has saved my old car from a non-start once, and given me peace of mind continuously since I purchased it.

One note: the green "charged" light never goes on the first time it is charged, but will after it's been charged, used at least once, and charged again. It seems to need to "learn" what the full charge is before it can register properly
</review_text><review_text>
I bought one of these when they first came out, because we have very hard water and I HATE shammying my car. The soap doesn't foam up like it would if you were bucket-washing, but it gets the car just as clean. I sort of like that it doesn't have a trigger device, as it avoids accidentally spraying the vehicle when you don't want to. Another plus is you don't have to wash your car with a bucket full of dirty water. The super-fast jet spray setting is not that useful for me, but I'm sure you off-roaders would appreciate it. I don't agree with the reviewer who said it causes more water spots. I don't think they used it right. If you wash your car pretty often, this kit comes recommended
</review_text><review_text>
I'm a female senior citizen.  I live on a 1 1/2 mile dirt road and commute 40 miles to another rural community (without a car wash)daily.  I really like a clean car.  In the past I would have the car washed on the rare occasions that I went to the big city.  Or wash it at home and deal with the mud underneath the car, etc.  It also snows here and there are times I can't wash the car.  This unit is unbelievable!  I love it.  NO water spots and it's easy to use.  There was a little leakage from the unit, however it's probably just an old woman not able to tighten enough.  I highly recommend this.  I washed two cars in 25 minutes
</review_text><review_text>
I've had this system for over a year, and it does in fact work as advertised.  I follow the procedure as described by Mr Pruss and end up with little or no water spots.  You do have to pay particular attention to any nooks where unfiltered tap water can accumulate and but sure to flush them well with filtered water in that last step. Failure to do so may end up with a trickle of unfiltered water running down the car as it dries.   I also echo the complaints about the soap compartment cap and lack of a good on-off trigger.  With the really hard water we have in So-Cal, I get maybe 8 vehicles washed on one filter cartridge.  I find it takes about half the time to wash my car and truck with this system vs drying by hand.  One other observation: the soap compartment has a line for maximum fill.  I got the impression, the time I accidently went way over that line, that a little soap was being dispensed along with unfiltered and filtered rinse water.  Or maybe soap was just oozing out of the contraption and getting into the rinse water that way.  Otherwise, I'm surprised how happy I am with it

Though I still encounter products not worth the time to laugh at, I have noticed more and more products coming to market that actually meet and sometimes beat expectations. 

Well, the Mr. Clean AutoDry Met expectations, though it does have a couple flaws.

I've owned this product since it first hit the store shelves, after a very hyped up Television marketing deal... I figured that if I bought it at Target and it does not work to my satisfaction, Target will give me my money back. I tried it, and it worked perfectlly. I knew from prior experience that de-ionised water will not leave spots as it is the ions of molecules in the water that are left behind when the water molecules evaporate. Remove those ions and there is nothing to be left behind. I was a little sceptical that such a small filter would work well, however, but for the most part, it has worked acceptably, but as the unit has some flaws, I should list them...

Flaw 1) The soap filler cap was badly designed. If there is any soap left in the unit when you store it, you have to be sure to store it so that the cap is upright (it is on the units side, not the top), else you will find a puddle of congealed, semi-dry soap when you pull it off the shelf a week later! There is no work around for this except to remember to store the unit upright, or lay on the other side.

Flaw 2) lack of a trigger for flow control. The unit uses a VERY peculiar flip switch which is a little difficult to flip on and off easily. It's not terrible, but a trigger like a garden sprayer would be SO much better!

Flaw 3) The hose connector does not turn freely... As you walk around the car, the hose twists and the water pressure tries to twist it back... This might be limited to the unit I purchased, but either way, it has been quite annoying. I found a perfect work around for this, though it did cost me a few extra dollars. I bought a hose quick disconnect that spins quite freely. it was a little expensive ($6, but works better than any other I have ever tried, and I simple screwed one end onto the autodry and the other onto the hose, and got some extra sprayer connectors ($4 each) for the other spray heads I use, and it's all good.

Other than the above three flaws, I am quite pleased with this product, and use it routinely. I can wash my car in about 30 minutes, and I am quite particular...

Here is the procedure I follow:

1) I quickly rinse down the whole car to get any dirt wet.
2) I then spray a section of the car, usually starting with the roof, with the soap
3) using a super soft, laundered wool wash mitt, I gently "scrub" the soaped area, and quickly rinse with unfiltered water, and ensure that the entire car remains wet.
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for other parts of the car (i.e. hood, trunk, sides, etc.),
5) Using the filtered water, starting from the high points of the car (i.e. roof) and working down to the sills, I completely rinse off the whole car and then let it dry, sun or shade. I've never had any spots whatsoever, except when the filter turns brown (which indicates the filter is exhausted)

After reading the review from Max I just had to let others know this product realy does work great. It also saves me time. Max's problem may be his whole process is flawed I never read the directions that may be how the product tells you to do it, however all I do is simple.

Wet the car (in my case truck) down with the regular water then wash the car,truck from the top down I use a microfiber towel and have the towel in one hand and the MrClean autowash in the other. I wash with soap and rinse as I go around the car,truck.
When it is all washed down re-rinse with regular water from the top down, change to the filtered water and rinse again from the top down. I do this part rather quickley it sprays just like a spray paint gun. then just let it sit and dry.

The reason I only give the product 4 stars is. The seal cap on the soap compartment leakes in storage if you dont prop it up just right or lay it on its side. And they really needed a trigger for the water controll, on and off.

I had used this all last summer im sure I washed my truck at least 20 times. and my water filter still worked fine. It may be my process and how fast I get around the truck or I may have cleaner water then what they say as only 10 washes per filter. I am back here to get a new one, beacuse I had kept it outside and well I cant expect it to hold up to a hard freeze can I? heh

I live in germany and my friend bring me the AutoDry to germany.I washed my black Tahoe in the sun..and IT WORKS!! GREAT!! But, you need a good water pressure, that the water is strong enough to wash the hard dirt away.

I bought this product for my husband. He tried it out on one of the hottest days. Sunny and 90 degrees. He is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours. This really works. Not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing. It looked as if he did the vehicles the old way. There were no streaks. The truck looked like it was polished. Unbelievable...... I would recommend this product to anyone. Buy it !!!!!!
</review_text><review_text>
This is a good product for the price. My only concern is when changing batteries the adhesive tape might be useless and must be replaced. I recomend it for use in the closed or in the kitchen under cabinet
</review_text><review_text>
Just be careful when using it in tinted windows. They filter out the sun and the motor doesn't spin

I had a check engine light problem with my car. I purchase the meter and it was able to determine the problem via the code. I was able to fix the problem with 1/4 of what the dealer charges. The meter saved me hundreds of dollars. Highly recommend it
</review_text><review_text>
I am surprised that the other reviewer of this product actually expected the code scanner to fix the problem,  My advice? Read the product description and you'll know all it is a DIAGNOSTIC CODE SCANNER" and not a 'DIAGNOSTIC CODE SCANNER PLUS MECHANIC IN A PLASTIC BOX".  It'll help you if you want to repair your own vehicle
</review_text><review_text>
Have you ever felt like your auto mechanic was "Mr. Wizard"?  All the way down to the bad attitude?  Only to find he has a doo-dad sitting somewhere out of eyesight that tells all, like a crystal ball...

Well for a reasonable price you can get your own crystal ball.  It might be able to predict the future and track flying monkeys but it can tell you very quickly why the "Check Engine" light has come on.  Big or small you know what might be waiting for you when you go see Mr. Wizard.  Sometimes you might even be able to track down the problem yourself and cut the cost to fix it.

I would not go to Oz without mine!

I just ordered this item from Amazon to be used on my 1995 Dodge Neon...

However, I have been searching in Product Description ¨What's in the Box¨,
and have noted that the Actron CP9135 comes with a CD Software...But the
CP9135 Do not have any visible PC (Serial RS232) conector...

It is true that this Actron CP9135 is Firmware Upgradeable - Anyone knows how to connect and perform this upgrade?

Thanks in advance

There's nothing worse than having that "Service Engine Soon" or "Check Engine" light come on. This scanner can give you some idea of what is going on under your car's hood. Easy to attach connector and simple navigation screens. Too bad it can't tell you how much the repairs will cost you
</review_text><review_text>
Easy to use.  My car frequently has the CEL for engine misfires.  I took it to the dealer and they said as long as it's running OK, don't worry about it.  Now when it happens, I can clear the light myself, for free
</review_text><review_text>
The scanner worked fine, although it reads out a generic code.  When I went to Actron's website and signed up for "lookups" which go into more detail, I found what I was looking for.  It was very detailed and helpful.  However, subsequent attempts to enter the "lookups" at Actron's website proved frustrating, after I had paid for them
</review_text><review_text>
If you are a tinkerer or a professional mechanic this tool is a must have for owners of 96 or newer vehicles. Youre blind without this information and can only guess at what is going on with your car. I keep it in the trunk of my car so when ever the check engine light comes I know instantly what the problem is.

Read out my OBDII error code with a one-line description and allowed me to reset it.  No problem
</review_text><review_text>
After reading several other reviews on the web for this product, I decided to place an order for one.  I just received the unit this week and immediately hooked it up.  You should set your engine size, fuel type (gas/diesel/hybrid), units of measure, and your fuel tank size - rounded down to the nearest whole number to allow for the best accuracy in the scangauge.  It's a simple installation.  Just plug it into your vehicle's OBDII port and choose a suitable mounting location that doesn't interfere with your other gauges or present a safety hazard.  (velcro strips are included for no muss/no fuss installation, but you could devise a more permanent mount)

Depending upon the parameters that your vehicle reports, here are some of the things this device can show you:

4 sets of trip data is stored - Current Trip, Today's Trip, Previous Day, and Current Tank.  In addition, fuel economy, fuel used, maximum coolant temperature, distance, maximum rpm, drive time, maximum speed, average speed, distance to empty, time to empty, and amount of fuel to empty.

The digital gauges are for fuel economy, fuel rate, digital speedometer, tachometer, manifold pressure, battery voltage, coolant temperature, intake air temperature, engine load, ignition timing, throttle position, and open/closed loop.  You can display any choice of 4 of these digital gauges on the gauge screen at one time and it's easy to cycle through them.  Not all vehicles will report every one of the above parameters through the OBDII interface.  If the data is not available for the chosen gauge, then there will be no display.

The final thing that this gauge is useful for is to read and reset trouble codes and your "check engine" or "service engine soon" lamp.  It captures the conditions present and stores them in flash memory if a trouble code is thrown so that you can review what state the various gauges were in when the trouble code triggered.

Again, I just received this item this week, but did quite a bit of research on it before purchasing.  I am very impressed by the amount of information the ScanGauge makes available.  Utilizing the data, I believe I'll be able to improve my gas mileage, as I will have instant feedback on my inputs as a driver.  It's fun to use too.  One other thing I forgot to mention is that you can program the back-light to 63 different colors.  It comes with 7 standard colors already programmed.

It works great and never falls down.  My dog isnt too rough with it, and Im not sure if she was if it would still stay up but it does what I needed it to do, keep her from sitting on my brand new car seats

I have a rottweiler and a pitbull and it keeps them both in the back of my explore

I installed this in my Mazda3 5 door wagon the day it arrived (which was very fast I might add).  It fit perfectly.  The height of the barrier was just low enough to fit in my wagon, so it didn't require a lot of adjusting that way.  The bars slide out on the sides to fit the width of the wagon nicely.  I've had my three Boston Terriers back there numerous times now.  No escaping possible!  I had looked through different pet stores for a barrier like this, but they were 3 times the price!  This is a great deal

This product satisfies about 95% of what I wanted it to.  It accomplishes the purpose - keeping the dog from jumping into the backseat.  However, the bottom stabilizing feet are a little awkward to adjust and tend to fall out of the apparatus if you don't secure them.  I also had a little trouble keeping the horizontal bar parts from slipping downward.  Overall, this product was worth the $26 or so dollars I paid for it

The LifeHammer is a good product, a bit small but I have seen tests on Mythbusters (Discovery Channel) and it seems to work just fine.  I purchased two different type hammers in the same transaction and was charged two different shipping fees from two different vendors which seems innefficient to me.  If I could find this product in a brick and mortar store, I would have purchased it there. 
</review_text><review_text>
I've never had to use this product, and don't ever want to. But it's hefty enough to do the job. Keep it in your console box or velcro it close by. Not in the glove compart where you can't reach it when needed. 
Price is right. I've ordered one for each member of my family. They say it's the best gift so far. I think that's because it's the thought that counts.
</review_text><review_text>
My wife wanted something like this to feel safer in the car. Not only does it break the glass, it also has a seatbelt cutter.
</review_text><review_text>
After watching Myth Busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests. My father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes. The lifehammers appear to be very well made and I fully expect them to do their job if ever needed. The Sheriffs Office just recently pulled a body out of a local river, his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river, his girlfriends body was found right away, but it took several months to find his body. If they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better. The LifeHammer is cheap life insurance

The tool everyone needs for the car - you never know when you will need it

It is good to know there is a safety tool like this on the market. Having had my mother killed in a car accident where she was trapped in her car, I have a better understanding of what might happen when you least expect it. I highly recommend this product. It is lightweight and well constructed, and the directions are easy to understand and follow. I hope everyone buys one.
</review_text><review_text>
Although this is one item that you never want to have to actually use, I did try it on an old piece of safety glass and it worked beautifully.  I will keep this in my car at all times, and will order the key chain hammer as well for myself and my family members

I don't know what this customer is talking about when he said it smells horrible... IT SMELLS LIKE A NEW CAR.  Not flowers, or fresh air, NEW CAR.  The stuff has worked great for me.  I've been using this brand and this smell for over ten years now.  My father turned me onto it and I haven't found an air freshener that deoderizes and makes my cars smell new like this one
</review_text><review_text>
Ozium's "That New Car Scent" is the closest scent to actual new car smell that I have tried. The store where I buy it no longer carries it, so I'm glad I found it here. I always get a lot of compliments from friends riding in my car that it smells great

This is one honker of a tire pressure gauge.  Good long reach for my F350 dually tires from the rubber handle dual foot valve via a flexible hose to a meter with a big display.  After one day's use, I don't see why the display doesn't always engage, but poking it onto the valve stem gets it going OK.  

Instructions not obvious that you must remove the red strip that protects the batteries.  Also not obvious how to get to the batteries, whatever they are, but I'll figure it out.  I may try another reviewer's idea to bend it 5 degrees for easier access thru the access holes to the valve.  Gotta use it a bit longer first.

Sure is a good gauge in any case
</review_text><review_text>
I bought this tire gauge specifically to check the tire pressure of my F350 dually.  The factory installed steel extenders made using pencil type gauges or other digital gauges impractical, particularly for checking the inner and outer rear tires.  Even though this gauge is sold for 'dual rear wheel trucks', I had to bend the steel tube about 5 degrees so it could make solid contact with the inner tire inflation stem.  Once it was bent, the gauge worked perfectly!  NOTE: I had friends at a machine shop bend the steel tube for me, it was too stiff to bend by hand or in a vice.  The gauge has big digits that are easy to read, even without my cheater glasses.  The air release button on the handle is convienent to use - even though I first thought it was for the display.  I have found it best to test the pressure, add more air than needed and then slowly release it using a combination of the button and disengaging and reengaging the gauge and testing until you get the desired tire pressure.  I found that if I failed to disengage and then reengage the tire pressure gauge, it tended to give me the same reading without resetting.  The guys at the garages always 'OHHHH and AHHHH' when I open the case and pull out this impressive tool.  It was well worth the money and Amazon had the best price of the various sites I visited while price shopping.  Oh, yea, I had to cut the plastic case a tad to allow for the bent tube to properly fit in the case so it would close

I had used Mothers wax about 20 years ago because it very good. Well it's still a very good wax. This wax followed by a coat of "top coat reflections" is just amazing. Glad I'm using it again and so is my car :
</review_text><review_text>
I bought this product for list price in a local auto store. Expensive (Amazon much cheaper), sure, but it goes on pretty thin, so the bottle should last a while.

It was really easy to put on and remove. I used a cotton applicator to put the wax over. It hazed over immediately and just a little pressure was needed to get the wax on the car. I didn't have to rub hard or anything. I waited just a minute (probably not even necessary to wait that long) and buffed off with a good microfiber towel (the Vroom stuff from Target worked great). I really shouldn't say "buffed", because I didn't have to press all that hard--the wax came off with light to moderate pressure.

I found this quite a bit easier to apply than the Meg's NXT wax.

The wax looks great. It has a deeper look to it than most pure synthetics, but also has some good shine to it. My car has a darker color and it added some depth to it. I applied it to my friend's black car, and it looked pretty wet.

It does have some cleaners in it, so it removed whatever fillers I had in my last wax and exposed the swirls a little more. If you are bothered by your car's swirls, you might want to consider a carnauba wax, as it will mask them better than this one.

I've had it on my car for 2 months now and the water is still beading nicely. I doubt it will last much longer, but I think that 2 months is not bad for a half-synthetic wax like this one.

Is this the top-of-the-line best-ever wax? No, but it DOES look great, and it is easy to apply. So I recommend it to all my friends who hate spending a lot of time on waxing their car
</review_text><review_text>
Goes on easy, and wipes off super, amazinglyl easy, and gives a very nice finish.
I'll wait a few months to see how long it lasts, but the application was a pleasant experience.
One thing - they said it doesn't get the black trim white, but it looks like it does - the white is starting to show about 2 weeks after I applied it.  It is possible that it is from my previous wax, but I don't think so since I covered that with Mother's Back-to-Black product.

It is really very nice, and my colleague would like to buy that too. They made my car looks very comfortable
</review_text><review_text>
the negative reviews of this thing most fall under that category of "it took too long" well that would be because you didn't let the oil warm up before trying to suck it through a thin piece of tubing...idiot.

if you follow the directions this thing works great, 5 stars &amp; I would buy it again in a heartbeat
</review_text><review_text>
I have used this item for 2 oil changes and it seems to work well.  I am concerned with the longevity of the hose connections however, I would be afraid that they could develop vacuum leaks over time since it is simply a matter of inserting the drain hose rather than a more formal type of attachment
</review_text><review_text>
I had read about evacuators on a few forums - it works as described.  No complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw 8 quarts.
that said, perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve.  

The fill/drain capability looked appealing, but if you don't need to use this device to fill fluids, I would opt for the drain-only device - less moving parts, fewer things can fail
</review_text><review_text>
The Mityvac appears to be a sturdy, well-built piece of equipment. I've used it twice and it is foolproof and fast. I really hated lying on the concrete garage floor in the past...this tool has eliminated that. 
</review_text><review_text>
I use this for changing the oil in my Mercedes S320.  It performs flawlessly and with minimal effort.  I look forward to using it again. 
</review_text><review_text>
Works well.
It operates a bit slowly but I assume that they all do.  This is not a problem and would not prevent me from purchasing it again.
A significant advantage of this unit is that the fluid can be evacuated from the unit w/o having to "pour" it out.  Others require opening the resevoir and pouring the fluid out.  This is useful when dealing w/ motor oil or other fluids that can be messy.
I am satisfied and would purchase it again.

</review_text><review_text>
Owning 2 mercedes, it is a pain to drain normally.  Using the MityVac, you insert the hose, pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil.  My only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid.  The resulting leak requires additional pumping to create more vacuum.  Still, it is definitely easier than lifting the car and crawling underneath to drain it.

I also tried on my truck engine and differential and found it easy to use.  It was a real time saver on the differential since I did not have to break the gasket for the cover

I bought this to use on a BMW motorcycle because it has awkward access to the pressure valve on the rims. It works beautifully and the spoken measurement is very handy when you can't see the readout. The readings are consistent with other gauges which I believe to be accurate so all in all this is a solid product and works as described

This unit works great... I bought it for my father and it works like it's supposed to. It has enough juice for a regular size CRT tv, and has been used to jump start a few times.

hi all 
I am very happy with the unit and the service from amazon in sending it to me .
It has the features I wanted it to have,  and is very easy to use

This Electromate 400 saved me serveral times I will never be with out another one. Love it. I ordered this from Amazon one day and the next day it was here Very fast shipping. Well pleased Thank yo

I haven't had to use it too much, thank goodness, but just knowing that it is in my car gives me peace of mind.  I did have to charge a camera battery on it and it worked great.  Love it
</review_text><review_text>
Fortunately my brother was nearby when I had a flat.  He pulled the Electromate out of his trunk hooked it up to the flat tire.  In about 20 minutes I was safely on my way to get the tire repaired.  I swore I would buy one, just in case he wasn't there next time, or worse yet, if I got stranded without help anywhere.  The jumper cables are a plus!!  I HIGHLY recommend this item to anyone
</review_text><review_text>
This unit is even better than I had expected. I read the reviews of those who have used it and decided that it was the better of the B&amp;D;'s that were also available.  A little pricier, but with the many features, it makes it worth the all-in-one package.  I was surprised it had DC plugs (for things you usually plug into the lighter).  Mostly I was looking for A/C plugs, and a jump-starting capability (for road trips, camping, etc.).  

A great deal, especially with the Amazon automotive promotion $20 off $100. 
</review_text><review_text>
Only minor drawback is the long time it takes to fill tires with the air pump. Otherwise I'm very pleased with this product.
</review_text><review_text>
This is an all around great emergency product for both car and home.  They only thing is that I wish they had the dimensions so that I could have assessed whether it would be too big or small
</review_text><review_text>
Seems that Amazon doesn't want to sell this item because they don't tell the most important thing about it, that is that it's a 0 - 60 psi gauge to be used for tires needing about 30 psi, give or take 10.  The illustration is incorrect, but they show the same picture for all the different Moroso gauges.  I measured accuracy against a digital and it's within .5 psi.  Best thing is that it makes a perfect and instant seal with the tire.  Put a little extra air in, press the button and it's an accurate fill.  I think the rubber cover is a must.  Amazon's is the best price
</review_text><review_text>
This cushion is very comfortable and retains its shape without being too firm.  It doesn't come with any straps or any way to secure it to the seat, so it does move around and fall forward when I get up.  Otherwise, I'm happy with it

Most people agree that U-locks are one of the best ways of locking up your bicycle.  I agree with that assessment, provided that there is something strong to which to affix the lock.  Whatever you lock your bike to, it has to be at the right height and of the right shape in order to be accessible by the U-lock.  I have seen many bicyclists in the DC area use their $100 U-lock to secure their $3000 bicycle to things like street signs, wrought-iron fences, rusty pipes, and even wooden park benches.  Street sign poles, which usually have a line of holes running down them, are designed to give and break away when hit by automobiles.  A thief could easily bend and break the street sign pole to get your bike.  I recently heard from a friend that their bike had been stolen because the thief merely pulled the loose pole from its decaying cement base.  A coworker's bike was stolen when the thief lifted the bike off the top of the pole after removing the bolted-on street sign.  Wrought iron fences can be easily broken by being kicked or leveraged at the welding points.  Rusty pipes, well, need I say more?  The point is, bike racks aren't always where you need them, and you can't always find something the right size to use your U-Lock on.  At two of the job sites I ride to for my work, the only things I can lock my bicycle to are gigantic street light poles.  The New York Chain was the only truly secure way to lock up my beloved bicycle.  The versatility of the chain is the best part about this locking system.  When I do use bike racks, I just either wrap the chain a few times around the bike or the racks, or I fix the lock to links that are closer together on the chain - easily accomplished if you pull the black sleeve back.

Now for the only complaint I have about the New York chain:  It is heavy.  Really heavy.  The first ride I took with the New York chain, I just threw it in my messenger bag and strapped the bag diagonally across my chest.  The weight was so lopsided that I felt myself leaning away from the bag just to improve my balance while riding.  For the first time ever, I used the twin shoulder straps that until then had been tucked into their pocket on the messenger bag.  Even then, the weight was enough to leave red chafe marks on my shoulders that evening after my ride home.  Maybe younger riders can handle the weight, but I'm a little further on in age and it is a bit much.  If your waist is skinny enough, you can wear it on your waist like a belt.  I tried it that way and if you put the lock in the back or on your non-dominant side it isn't all that bad.  But my bicycle touring experience tells me that this is one of those items that you should really carry on the bike if at all possible.  I don't recommend the handlebars - makes the steering sluggish.  The top tube is okay, but the lock has a nasty habit of swinging into your knees as you pedal.  Eventually I had to start carrying a laptop computer around for work, so I got a luggage rack with panniers.  Throwing the chain in the panniers was definitely the easiest option.  When you're not carrying anything else in the panniers, the trunk bag is an even better place for it - the weight is higher on the bike, yes, but it is centered.

Overall, I like this lock for its versatility in locking options, allowing me to lock my bicycle to anything large and immovable.  I think this is the best way to get the highest level of Kryptonite security.  However, if bike racks were more abundant in my area, I would gladly give up the extra weight by getting a standard U-Lock

This little gizmo really does work. It seems to be pretty accurate, too, although it's tough to tell.
You need to give it a good strong blow to get enough air through the little opening to get a good reading. I've tried using a straw to direct the air better and that seems to work. Unfortunately, there's no sensor that lets you know when it has enough air to take a reading. If there's not enough it just stays green even if there is alcohol present in your breath. Still, for the price it's pretty darned impressive.
You'll need to experiment a bit because the instructions aren't very accurate
</review_text><review_text>
Finally got to try this item out when my wife and I did some bar hopping a couple of weeks ago.  We delayed our drive home until the device gave us the all clear.  Of course the big question is whether the readings were accurate and without a calibrated reference device on hand, this currently remains unanswered.  Indirect evidence (our known consumption rate, body weight, and subjective feelings) suggested the device was in the ballpark.  Since I do have access to a more accurate (and far more expensive) tester at work, I may attempt some experiments and will report back the findings here.  

The device is very easy to carry around and is quite unobtrusive. Glancing at it, one would assume it is just a keyless entry.  And it is definitely at a good price point.  Since these type of devices are a great aid in being a responsible drinker of alcohol, it would likely benefit society at large if their use became common.  It should be remembered, however, that one can still be cited in most places while driving when BAC is above zero even if the levels don't reach the most serious DWI/DUI standards so having a designated driver still remains the best option.

Saved me twice so far... Tow rope got me out of a snow bank... Has almost everything you need, some things are kind of cheap, but in general, the product gets the job done..

I only had a chance to use it once so far. It's been really cold and I have had no desire to go out there and check the air pressure of my tires. The only time I used it, it worked fine. This is my 3rd air compressor for the car. The first one was stolen from my car, but it got me out of trouble a couple of times. That's why I decided to buy the second one. It's a Craftsman unit that doesn't work any good at all. So I went online and did some research and read a couple of reviews for different units and decided to go for this one. The only thing I don't like is that you loose some air from the tire when you try to unscrew the hose. You just have to put two extra PSI's

I rate this product a 5 star, although I haven't used this product yet, decided to purchase it as a result of the review of motorcycle tire inflator's in the MOTORCYCLE CONUMER NEWS, just wanted to have one to carry in saddle bag of my HD Ultra Classic, in case it was needed

Well, I bought two of this. I have only used one and it works fine. Looks very nice and feels solid in your hands. 
The only thing i dislike is that it sounds and vibs too much for my taste, but not a big deal..
</review_text><review_text>
it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets

Small but reliable. It helps me to save gas and tires. Thanks for it

It looks funny in the ad BUT it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure + I liked the bright colors so they don't get out of sight.

We needed a way to haul three adult-sized bicycles from our home base to various cycling paths. So I visited a number of local stores to see what my options were. I settled on the Yakima BigHorn 4 as the best option for my budget, then discovered through some online searching that I could purchase the next model up, the Yakima KingPin 4 bike rack for a bit less than the BigHorn 4 would run me in a traditional retailer.

The KingPin 4 folds features a fold-down mast, a must convenience to allow access to a vehicle's rear hatch or door. Although I would not consider a bike rack without this feature, be forewarned: once you lower the rack while it's loaded with three bikes (more about the fourth bike claim follows), you will be hard pressed to single-handedly reposition it and slide in the lock or bolt. There is too much weight on that pivot point. 

I soon learned, therefore, that it was easier to have the mast folded up, not down, when loading the bikes. 

The dual bike arms are a must, allowing for more stability and easier loading and unloading. The bike arms fold down as well, though this option, while useful, is not essential in many cases. (These folding bike arms are the main difference between the KingPin and BigHorn racks.)

A series of bike cradles and rubber "chainstraps" stabilize and anchor the bikes. You can slide theses cradles along the tubular arms to allow sufficient room to avoid any rubbing or scraping if you are carrying three bikes. (I looked as some less expensive racks that required hand-tightening one or more big bolts to tighten clamps that held the bikes. That system seemed like a royal pain and huge annoyance.)
 
Despite the name and billing, I'm less confident in recommending the KingPin4 for transporting four bikes. I think it's possible, but would require great care to avoid scraping paint or entangling pedals and spokes. Plus, I prefer using four "chainstraps" per bike for a bit of insurance, so if you want to carry four bikes, I would recommend springing for another set of these. 

The unloaded contraption weights about 32 pounds, so it's not too heavy as you carry it from the basement or garage to install it. But be careful of the arms or you might shatter the glass in a door or an outside light. Also, you need to do a bit of assembly out of the box, so allow a good 30 minutes to set up and test the rig before using it the first time. The drawings in the instructions did not seem to match what I was actually looking at when I had everything before me on the floor, so I spent an extra few minutes considering the options. This assembly is not difficult---it's just that adage "never do anything for the first time" may stump one for a bit.  

I am using this rack with a two-inch hitch, and I purchased a locking pin to replace the bolt that is shipped for attaching the rack to the hitch. I also run one of the cable bike locks through the bike frames and around the spanner between the arms to add a measure of security. 

During our first foray, a 100-mile trip each way, the bikes and rack swayed just a bit from time to time, but overall, the sway was not a problem. Having a hundred extra pounds jutting up behind the rear window will change any vehicle's handling and hamper visibility through the rearview mirror, so be prepared to change your driving style as needed. 

To conclude, the KingPin 4 has performed well. We could load and unload three bikes in about five minutes, and neither the Durango or bikes were scratched during transport. But, again, I would suggest that this rack is great for three bikes, but may be a challenge for carrying four.

Many useful features in this design: compact but capable and rugged.  A recommended item for emergency power outages, and for general service where portable power is needed: starts dead car batteries, pumps tires, runs 120V tools, etc.

Two design shortcomings I hoped weren't there, keep it from 5 stars - #1: it charges from either a wall-wart 12V adapter, or from a 12V cigarette lighter plug.  I much prefer a direct 120V power cord connection versus the wall adapter variety.  #2 shortcoming: it doesn't have a self float-charge cycle - you must limit your charge times manually by unplugging it (battery damage if charged too long).  Ach!  Still, guess a person could attach his own float-charge unit instead of the supplied 12vdc adapter.  But heck, Wagan, design that into it, like the better powerpacks have

I just got this myself and it works like a charm.  Installation took atbout 1/2 hour and it works just like it advertises.

I couple of things.  I agree with the need to place the solar cell within a couple of inches of the garage door light.  I have a sears craftsman with a flourescent bulb which is enough with the solar cell right above the light.  There is a pressure stick pad that holds the solar cell onto the garage door opener.  There is a black 3-4 foot wire (looks like an RCA audio wire and plug) that connects the solar cell to the laser beam generator which is maybe about 3/4" long and about 3/8s of the inch wide.  It too has a stick adhesive to be glued onto your garage ceiling.  The laser pivots easily so it can be aimed.

The actual beam emits a pulsing red dot not bigger than 1/8" wide onto your dashboard when you drive under it.  It takes a little getting used to a first to know what to look for when you're parking.  My garage ceiling is about 2 feet above the roof of the car so it's pretty close to the laser generator.  If you have a higher ceiling, the mounting is probably harder but the dot is maybe slightly bigger.  The one thing that I have to adjust is that my wife is shorter than me so she sees the beam alittle later than I do and has to sit up a bit in the seat to see it on the dashboard of our Toyota Sienna which is a little flat.  I need to re-aim the laser to an easier to spot point for her since this is her parking slot.  

Works like a charm - just wish the dot was little bigger to make it easier to spot when you pull in.  Great feature not to have any batteries or plug ins required
</review_text><review_text>
Works just as advertised, but requires a bit more light than just sticking it on the outside of the light cover. By tucking it under the cover you get a nice bright blinking dot. No batteries, no outlet, no transformer brick
</review_text><review_text>
A tennis ball on a string will perform the same function but this is much cooler!
Set-up was very easy although the person who wrote the instructions clearly did not have a full understanding of the subtle nuance of the English language.
The idea that the unit is solar powered (driven by the garage door opener lights) is simply brilliant. No batteries to replace, ever.
Aiming the laser was tricky in my case as both cars in the garage are jet black and my idea of beaming the laser on the car was abandoned after discovering how difficult it was to see the laser light in the black finish.
I settled for finding a spot to shine the laser (it creates a red line)on the garage wall and I would be able to drive the car forward until the line dissapeared from sight. That would then be the ideal stopping point. This worked well with only one problem I did not discover until nightime. 
Driving into the garage with the headlamps on washed out the laser marking and required that I turn off the headlamps before docking.
With all this little issues, I still think this is very handy little product and I have had no problems with the way it works. Once aimed, a little loc-tight or nail polish on the screw for the laser head mount is probably a good idea as a slight movement of the beam after you have developed a strong trust in using the laser light as a guide could potentially result in thousands of dollars of repair to home and auto.

The laser parking system works great! It took me 5 minutes to install and now my wife can park her way oversized SUV in our garage with little problem. No kidding there is 1 inch to spare in the front before she hits the shelves and 3 inches in the back so the garage door can close. With the laser she hits the mark everytime
</review_text><review_text>
I bought this from Northern Tool for $9.00 and found a much better product than I expected. The 75 watt bulb in my door opener powers the Solar cell without a problem, guess Andrew got a defective unit or is trying to use this with the light guard over the bulb, It must be in direct view of the bulb. The laser points to a spot on my dash allowing for perfect parking every time.

ok, this is the item to have.
Looking for an easy in-expensive parking system:  This is it.
well, I own a Ferrari and a 'two' car garage. NOTHING comes with in 3' of my-precious.....but, parking this beauty in what has now become a space shuttle simulation area, requires precise skills, of course which I have...goes without saying.   Looked at the in-floor bumpa systems but that required sticky tape and cleaning about it wasn't good.  Desired the electronic stuff but hated the thought of electricity and such and the cost of some was too high to justify:      ENTER THIS ITEM Which is pure spot-on. It uses for power, get this, your garage door's light.  There is a light activated switch that triggers the laser to fire in a blinking fashion. VERY compact, VERY easy to install, VERY small [laser is about 1.5" long.  The solar powering of the laser works like a charm, the trigger works perfectly and NO POWER SOURCES to worry about.  If it doesn't work it means you didn't open the door [separate problem] or the garage light is out [separate problem].  THIS DEVICE IS HOT and after several months, still is attached, and works like a charm:  GET THIS ONE

The great thing about this is that if you've ever strugged with ear-buds, or something similar you'll never have to do so again!

I have basically forgotten that these are in my helmet, the setup is seamless.  The wires fit perfectly under the padding in most helmets and the female connect is then attatched with velcro to the underside lip on the side of your helmet, so when not in use you really don't notice it.

When you need it..reach up and connect your music male connector.  Piece of cake!

The only downside is that it's not very loud at it's loudest setting with my MP3 player.  Not sure if that's a fuction of the speakers or the player.  It's loud enough to enjoy though

I recieved the Mr. Clean Auto Dry system for fathers day. Im usually skeptical about products that are new to the market place, and one with the incredible claim that this product makes, that it will give a spot free shine without using a towel, well quite frankly I was very skeptical about this products claim. I used it today and was very impressed. It took about 10-15 minutes to dry but when it did, my beautiful silver car looked better than when I used a shamois. It was very easy and it saved me the elbow work and the 20 minutes I would have spent drying the car. I am a big fan of the auto dry system, and will never towell dry again
</review_text><review_text>
Been using Mr Clean AutoDry system for a while now.  As long as the filter refill is not used up (stops deionizing the water), you'll get a nice sheeting effect when you rinse the vehicle off, allowing it to dry spot-free.  The thing you have to remember is that this isn't a pressure washer, or anything other than a system.  You have to wet the vehicle, wash with the system's soap, and then rinse with normal water.  When you're ready to dry, use the filtered water, and then let dry!  Best if you wash your vehicle in a shaded area, or the soap/rinse water will dry leaving spots.

The only negative I have with it is that it doesn't last very long when you've got a full-size truck and a minivan that needs washing.  After 2-3 washes of my vehicles (total, not each!) the filter doesn't deionize as well.  But sure does make drying much easier on these big vehicles!  No more hand drying for me

I have a stainless steel table top and was very disappointed when trying to clean it with standard household cleaners. Most cleaners would only leave a dull finish and streaks.

I used the compressor to add air to 4 tires, approx. 5-7 psi per tire and it worked fine, didn't take too long.  However, there are 2 problems with the device - 1. After adding air to 2 tires the rubber inside the nozzle was already ripping and becoming unattached so that it would get in the way when trying to connect it to the valve stem, after 4 tires it was very ripped up.  2. The compressor vibrates so much that you can't put it onthe ground while running or it falls over.  I guess that's the price you pay for the light weight of the compressor.  While the rubber seal is a concern, it's not enough for me to return the compressor because it did work.  I only hope the seal doesn't get so bad that the nozzle won't keep a good connection with the valve stem

This oil pan is great for changing your oil multiple times, depending on your  kind of car or truck.  It is easy to work with, not too large, and will help you save a lot of money on oil changes, being that doing it yourself costs around fifteen dollars, versus the fifty dollars it will cost you at a mechanic.  Plus, oil changes take only around fifteen minutes and you can dump your oil at any local mechanic like Jiffy Lube or Grease Monkey.  You can't go wrong with this oil pan

I bought this for 'just in case' scenario.  It happened about three weeks after purchase.  Dead battery on my pickup.  Previously, I had followed the mfg's recommendation/instructions for a newly purchased unit and unit was fully charged.

This thing is great, I had to jump start pickup 3 times before finding out I had a defective battery and needed to replace.  It kept me from being stranded.  It is simple and foolproof to operate.  It has worked form me and sits in my garage fully charged again.  It is cheap insurance and saves having to call a friend or a tow truck for a jump start.  I wished I had purchased earlier. GOOD BYE JUMPER CABLE

i just walked a mile to buy this, cause my car is dead, and i don't know anyone in this town yet.  I'm excited to have found this, but it really would be nice to have even a 3-4 inch power cord so i can use my extesion cord that has a double sided female end.

As it is though, you need an extension cord that is made for only plugging in one unit to female end, cause the blades on Instant Power are recessed in a small area. 

I'm sure this product functions well, the owner at ACE hardware told me he has one and he loves it.  It is frustrating though, to have to walk right back to the store again in freezing temperatures, just cause the product doesn't come with cord, nor say on the box that one is required but not included.

Actually, i just noticed it does say on box "just connect an extension cord."  But that wouldn't have prevented my hastle if i had seen that at the store.  Cause i have an extension cord, just not one with only one female connection.

I've learned from my mistakes. I've purchased two of the cheaper jump starters (one Coleman, one Vector, probably made by the same folks) and both stank. They don't give enough power to do than more than a couple of cranks in warm weather, and are worse in the cold. Worst of all, the cheap plastic clamps broke. It was difficult to open them wide enough.

This charger, on the other hand, works very well, and it's a great value. Lots more power, charges up efficiently, and has solid all metal clamps. You do need an extension cord with a small enough female end to charge it, but that's easily found.

BTW, aside from the obvious uses of this product, it's nice to have the male-to-male cigarette lighter extension cord. This allows you to provide power to your vehicle when you are swapping out that dead battery that was giving your problems, which means that all the electronic settings in your vehicle are preserved during the swap

This product is great.  Now I no longer have to guess where to stop when parking.  With limited space in our garage I was always stopping to short and the garage door wouldn't close or to close and hitting the garbage cans.  Now I no longer have to guess.  Great bu

This product just arrived. I am very impressed by the quality of the material and the zipper. I have adjusted the roof rack on my FJ Cruiser and may put something in the bottom of the carrier for support- we will see if that is needed. This product is cheaper and of higher quality than those seen in department stores

This carrier worked well on our Honda Pilot.  It kept several large suitcases dry.  We used several large bungee cords to secure it.  The only problem was that it made noise but we taped them down.  The fabric kept them very well protected.  I would recommend it for anyone needing the extra space in their car

We needed a car top carrier for a drive from Arizona to Utah.  After much research, we decided to give the Kar Pak a try.  It worked wonderfully!  We fit two suitcases, a duffle bag, and some random stuff in garbage bags on top of our minivan.  During the drive, we weathered snow, sun, and rain.  We were on the road for a total of 13 hours.  By the time we reached our destination, everything inside the Kar Pak was dry and perfect. The Kar Pak itself was easily washed off, folded up in it's box, and put into storage.  This is a great option for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a car top carrier.  It's easy to install, doesn't budge (we checked the straps several times during the trip, they never loosened or anything), and it keeps everything inside dry if it rains or snows. 
</review_text><review_text>
The carrier held 2 huge suitcases and several other duffle bags and packages.  We went thru a snow and ice storm on a 1200 mile trip to 
Orlando and there was not a drop of water inside.  I also purchased a bungee web to put over the top for the extra security and this worked out well. There was no wind noise even when traveling 75 mph.  Great item
</review_text><review_text>
  I am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000+ mile tour from Nebraska to Florida with this on the top of my Subaru and I must say it was great thing to have- everything stayed bone-dry and secure but I would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure- plenty of room and solid construction- for the price it can't be beat

I purchased this bag and drove over 1600 miles in rain and snow. The product performed wonderfully. I noticed small water droplets when I finally opened it after six days. This may have been due to opening and closing the bag to take things out during the trip.

I really have nothing negative to say about this bag. If you need a bag for your car roof, buy this one
</review_text><review_text>
I knew we needed this thing with 7 people crammed in a van, but I'm short, so I was leary. No problem. It saved our travel experience and wore very well. Easy to work with. Well worth the price, which wasn't bad to begin with
</review_text><review_text>
We purchased this item to travel to the mountains for Christmas.  We drove 7 1/2 hours in the pooring rain.  Our luggage stayed completely dry.  It easily attached to our mini van luggage rack and stayed secured the duration of the trip.  This bag is awesome and reasonably priced!

Our first experience with a cargo carrier was over Christmas.  We were really counting on it and things worked great.  It is very spacious, easy to pack and stores nicely

This carrier is very good.  Only one draw back.  The zipper only went around on two sides.  Would be much easier to load if the zipper went around the third side as well so the top open like a flap

It does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location.  I had to remount/move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position.  The forward/backward adjustment of the laser after mounting the unit is helpful but not being able to adjust the laser side to side after mounting scored it a 4 instead of 5 star rating from me
</review_text><review_text>
This parking assist works as described.  Its easy to install but the laser doesn't stay on long enough and even with the car in motion the light sometimes goes off before the car comes to a stop because it doesn't detect motion on the smooth, one-color surface.  My wife can't see the light on the front of the hood because she line of view is lower than mine, however, I find it working fine
</review_text><review_text>
This little gadget works well!  It's easy to install, the motion detector works as advertised, and most importantly, it does help us park our cars accurately in our crowded garage.  I tried other devices, but they didn't work.  
I'm glad I bought these little dealios. They've made my life infinitely better, my wife is happier, and my dog likes me again
</review_text><review_text>
After reading the other reviews, I had to speak up.  I've tried it all: the garage bump, the stop light type system, etc.  You mount this unit on the ceiling and point it to a specific point on your car so you know where to stop.  In my case, I point it at the dash.  When I enter the garage, the laser turns on and because the laser is very bright, you can follow it as it tracks along your hood.  If you set it up right, this helps you set the distance between your cars or the side garage wall. For example, you can set it to run only the seam of your hood or the middle crease if you have one. Then when it reachs the dash, I watch for it to land in a specific area and stop.  A successful park, usually with only an inch or two variance.  It so rocks
</review_text><review_text>
The Park Smart Mats work, that is if your're a good aim.  Really these mats need to be about twice as wide.  The mats are about a foot wide and as you are pulling up to them you can not see them because the hood of your vehicle blocks your view.  Consequently,if you're not lined up perfectly you'll drive right past them.  That being said, they're still the best non-electronic item on the market for stoping your car where you want it
</review_text><review_text>
Overall, I am satisfied.  So far I have not experienced creep, but I move my car into position very very slowly, so that may help.

My one suggestion is that it could be wider.  It is easy to slide by if I am just a little off line.

I have yet to try it on my boat trailer, so that will have to be covered later

I've used GS27 on two cars of mine that had scratches. I've noticed it will permanently remove or greatly improve nearly all minor to medium scratches. It really depends on the scratch and how deep it is. It works like MAGIC on some scratches and dramatically improves most other mild to medium grade scratches. It works alot like a car wax as far as application/removal. You have to buff it off with a cloth and it will have a brilliant shine. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it doesn't completly remove all scratches.

This is a fine product. The 3 LED bulbs pack a vast amount of illumination. I ordered 4 of them and have no problem lighting up my whole livingroom. I left 1 unit on for over 6 hours and its was still burning brightly when I chose to shut it off. You will not be disappointed with these. Awsome
</review_text><review_text>
Don't confuse these with the cheap ones going around. Cheap ones have only 1 led light and no batteries. These come with  batteries and have 3 led light in each unit. I bought these for a bookshelf and curio cabinet. I have come up with 1000 more uses and ordered 12 more. You won't be disappointed. I have been looking for these for about 2 years and finally found them

I finally had to upgrade my old faithful 35-year-old Schumacher 6 amp charger - not because it quit working, but because it didn't have enough horsepower to handle the big 105 ampere-hour trolling motor battery in my boat. I wanted a higher capacity unit, but with the same solidly built reliability I've experienced with my old Shumacher charger. This unit was priced quite a bit less than some other brands with similar capability, so I was a little afraid Schumacher, like many companies, might have gone the "cheap" route with their products by using a lightweight case and cheap components. Not so! I was pleasantly surprised to find this is a solid, heavy, well built charger in the best Schumacher tradition. Well designed with a very stout plastic cabinet with pop-up carrying handle, informative and easy to use front panel controls, and nice features like automatic no-spark battery connecting/disconnecting even if you forget to unplug it first, plus automatic polarity protection, and a looong power cord with a handy place to store the cord. I found only a single minor negative:  If I had to change anything about this unit, I'd find a quieter fan. The fan, although it's pretty loud for it's size, is at least automatic and only runs when needed, so this is no big deal to me, since I only run it in my shop/garage. Haven't tried the "start" function, which I consider a more or less useless frill for a charger of this size, but it certainly charges all types of batteries like a champ, and the automatic quick charge/maintenance charge function works great. I highly recommend this great little charger
</review_text><review_text>
Excellent product, and the Amazon deal (free shipping and a large price drop) made it a no brainer.  The unit is a rugged, very flexible charger from a major company in the business.  The de-sulfinization (or is it de-sulfation ?) battery conditioning feature can bring back a battery you would otherwise have to replace (I've used it successfully already), and the 65 amp boost mode can start a car with a weak battery that you would otherwise have to jump (used that too.)  I'm very satisfied with this unit, it's light years ahead of anything near the price I paid that I would find at Sears ...
</review_text><review_text>
Does a good job for what it was designed for... did have some trouble "recognizing" certain types of batterie
</review_text><review_text>
Works fast and good.  This is a great charger.  Anybody can use this.  The voltmeter and % of battery indicator is nice, I don't have to check the battery with my multi-meter.  Havn't used the alternator tester yet but have no doubt it works.  By far the best charger I've seen and used.  However it is noisy, but who needs total silence in a garage
</review_text><review_text>
This unit has done everything I expected of it and it was not overly expensive, considering the features

This is a great battery charger that you need if you have a boat and trolling motor.  High quality and easy to use

After trying every wiper from the $2 "Wally World" variety to even the most expensive Bosch wipers, I've found performance and longevity was actually about the same throughout the spectrum of windscreen wipers I was very disappointed in how long they would last (about 2-3 months of perfect wiping). 

Before purchasing a set of the ICON wipers for my Volkswagen Golf I was about to spend a few hundred $$$ on OEM wipers "Aero" from the R32, which seem very similar to these. After more than six months of use I am glad to say they still perform very well and there is yet no need to replace them. I only wish Bosch would make a 13" version for the rear window

After trying just about every other pricier wiper blade on the market, and being disappointed every time, I decided to spring the extra money for this one (no, they are not cheap) and see if paying the extra money made all that much of a difference. I only bought one initially, on a rainy day when my driver side wiper had flown off the car on my way to work, and then immediately ran back and got one for the passenger side, too, after I'd only gone a mile down the road. These wipers are incredible. I swear my windshield looks better now than it ever has. No smearing, no streaking, and complete water removal. They also work better at removing bugs from the windshield in conjunction with the car window washer fluid than any other wiper I've ever used. Now I'm curious about the longevity of the wiper blade. I'm hoping they last longer than others, too (given the price.
</review_text><review_text>
I know, who thinks of looking for anything special when replacing your wiper blades.  Get the cheapest ones from the auto parts store and forget about it, right?  Well, if you have to deal with even the smallest amount of ice or snow, these blades are incredible.  They wipe clean and smooth every time and never clog up with ice or snow.  They sit low and tight on your windshield and don't skip or chatter at highway (or higher) speeds.  While $20 bucks each may seem like a lot, consider your safety in bad weather and how effectively these blades clean your windshield, and you'll thank yourself every time.  Buy them through amazon as they're the best deal around.  Every auto parts store that had them wanted almost twice the price

it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets

I found the product to be very useful myself; wiring diagrams are better than any books I had seen and now I know why. The information here comes from Mitchell1; most of the pro technicians I know pay good money every month to use it. The vehicle has a leak near the tailgate area and there were some Honda tech bulletins here that I never knew about. It was worth it just for that and details of the "surprise" third fuse panel under the hood. True, some of it might be over your head, but overall I found eAutoRepair to be a great deal for a car savvy do-it-yourselfer.

I have a Nissan Sentra so I guess the steering wheel is a little bit smaller than other cars.  I had the easiest time to put it on.  It popped right on.  It doesn't slide around either.  I bought it to protect my hands from a hot steering wheel basked in the sun all day.  It's a beautiful steering wheel.  I got seat covers to match with it.  amazon has the best price.  I definitely recommend you guys to buy it.  I usually don't write reviews so this is how satisfied I am with it

Very impressed so far. Used it to recondition 2 batteries and charge up 2 others and it has worked flawlessly.  Never impressed with Black and Decker tools but I think they got it right this time.  Time will tell and I would have given it 5 stars if it holds up for a few years

You have to be very careful how you apply this product. The instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution, only then will it work. If you use too much, you will experience the "oil and water" effect the other rater stated. Otherwise, this product works very well, remember to reapply when you see the effects going away
</review_text><review_text>
I've loved this product since I first got some from my dad in many years ago.  Forget the car.  I use it in my bathroom!  Stepping out of a shower and being able to see in the mirror is great.  No more trying to blow dry the mirror or wiping with a towel only to leave behind wet streaks and having the mirror re-fog again.  This is the greatest. I almost thought they stopped making it because I couldn't find it in the last 2 automotive stores I visited (it came bundled with the regular Rain-X for windshields...also good) but now that I see it on-line, I know I can buy it again

This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car

Get yourself a can of "photoblocker" and this license plate or risk being victimized by some deputy do-right and his shiny new toy: the traffic camera. Rumor has it that several class-action suits are underway while others have been won against these cameras. I lost $180 in tickets to the fiefdom of Chicago before installing this system. The tinted lense covers your plate and protects you from losing your tag. My tag has been stolen once and weather took another during the past 4 years. The solution I chose was a couple of coats of photoblocker with the smoke cover lense over the top; I tried to get a polarizing sheet from 3M but they would not sell it to me because most states are making these defenses illegal. The principle of operation is simple: the photoblocker reflects back the light from the camera flash, the smoky lense deadens some of that reflection but obscures it (like a polarizing sheet)making it even harder to read than with the photoblocker alone. Also, by itself, the lense will make it a little harder to see your numbers in daylight. By law, your numbers must be visible but there is no scientific minimum so anything you can do to inconvenience the cops will benefit you. 

FYI: photoblocker works because the traffic cameras need the flash. It is all about shutter speed. To capture a clear picture of a moving object --obviously, you are racing through a stop sign-- you must have a flash. If you tried without the flash the shutter speed would be too slow to catch anything but a blur. By sending a pulse of reflected light you cause the photo to be over-exposed. One of the makers of the traffic camera says that all they have to do is re-develop the picture. Perhaps, but I seem to remember you would need to develop two pictures and put together the photos. This seems like a lot of trouble for a police department and may even require re-programming the software for their digital cameras. They probably won't bother: there are lot of people without counter-measures and the cameras costs them a fortune anyway.

Everything a mechanic needs, without having all those little bottles and cans leaking every where. The sticks allow precise application of thread sealer or anti-seize. The sticks don't leak or spill, the y don't have nozzles that clog... they are perfect. No waste!

They were a good deal before but now with the new low price you can afford to get two kits!, buy this and you will not be sorry

This 16 ft. Coleman jumper cable is a 4 gauge cable which is a mechanic's grade.  It is durable and will last a long time.

It comes with a  lifetime warranty and I am very glad that I bought it

this spray will drown out anything.  works great in the car.  spray for 1 second in the center of the room and it freshens for hours.  i don't smoke but i'd bet that ozium would easily take the smoke out of the air just the same.  i know some people don't like the sweet strong smell, but i think it's growing on me.

I dont know what I had on my car before these but they were nothing compared to these blades. I bought them because they were cheaper then the euro blades that are popular for Volkswagens but they still have the same look. I couldnt be happier. They sweep everything away. Its a much sleaker look then braket style wipers. I recomend these to anyone who either wants a good wiper blade or a nice euro look to there car.

1st of all I am sure that everyone has hated how ugly the winter wiper blades are, they are bulky, and just do not look good.  Now the ICONS are sleek and small, they look great!  They perform awesome in all weather conditions(I have used them in rain, sleet, and snow, and in a blizzard) they handle everything perfectly.  No annoying streaks, and they sweep everything away, the do not miss anything!!  Sure they are more expensive than other blades, but you really do get what you pay for!  Awesome wiper blades I would recommend them to EVERYONE

I bought this because I was moving from Boston, MA to Phoenix, AZ and driving myself and my 2 daughters.  I was able to fill this thing to maximum capacity- and was able to fit a small padlock on the zipper to secure it shut.

It rained and snowed on our trip and luckily, we had everything already wrapped up in plastic bags - this is not a waterproof cargo bag, but rather, water *resistant*.

When we got to Phoenix, I noticed that the front part of the bag had frayed and a hole formed.  I think this was more do to the straps that were hanging and hitting it than poor craftsmanship.

I recommend this bag if you are doing a short trip, but not for long haul trips with a lot of highway driving.

Good points:  Was able to fill it really well, was very easy to install
Not so good:  straps really can't be secured down and end up flapping in the win

Ths is exactly what I needed. I have so many 12volt DC products I need connected at the same time and this definetly helps. I like thatI can mount it where I need to, and there is a good sized cord that comes with it. The built in LED "Power usage" indicator lights are nice, especially if you have your engine off and your woried about your batter. If it goes from green to orange, start your vehicle and you won't have to worry if your battery is going to die

The life hammer is of a solid construction and one can see that it is a quality product.
I got one of these after seeing it on a episode of MythBusters, the amazon "glow in the dark" version is pretty neat and works very well.

This is a saftey item that I feel is well worth every last cent

I had been looking for a new gauge, and really had my eyes on an analog dial type.  I found one surprisingly hard to find at local stores, so I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon, and at a really decent price.

This Accu-gage model is simply great.  Solid construction and finish.  It's the perfect size.  Perhaps the best feature is the release valve function, which holds the acquired pressure reading from your tyre, until you press the little thumb button to release the air pressure from the gauge.

Can't say any more about it other than 'works and looks great.

I've used design tech products fo over 5 years and probably put at least 5 in my family cars. The only problem is there tech support isn't what it used to to be. There is one company that took over most of the remote starters and the tech help isn't as good. I tried a bulldog for my son's wife's car and the quality isn't near Design tech. I've had them in vehiciles over 5 years or more without few problems. Caution if you installing on some of todays cars you need to purchase other products to get around the security systems. You still need a key to steal the car or a professional thief. An electrical back ground is needed to install this product. They have a good color chart for wiring. Frank Nielse

I installed this item on my 2001 Dodge truck shortly after I purchased my truck in Nov. 2000.  I have not had any problems with the unit at all.  My key fob has worn out, though it has seen some abuse.  I installed the unit myself using their instructions.  The install did take longer than I anticipated, but mostly because it sometimes took a bit to find the correct wire in the truck.  In all, it has great features at a fair price
</review_text><review_text>
I have a 2005 Ford Ranger.  I bought this unit and fully read the instructions before starting the install.  After that I began searching for the right connecitons on the steering column and connected up the unit.  I went online to find the correct placement of the wires and downloaded a printout.  
The unit installed well, worked fine after initialization.  Came with a video that really helped in the installation.  I find the range on this unit to be super.
I have no complaints
</review_text><review_text>
I have read down thru the reviews and I would like to point out some issues I have with some low scores.. 

First, why would someone give a low score to something they purchased knowing it had the least features of any other units.  The ratings are about the unit in question. 

Second, if you read the code, then start throwing parts at your car having no mechanical knowledge, don't come here and start complaining that this unit didn't do your dishes for you too. 

This is an inexpensive tool that will allow you to get the information from you car, and can also clear a CEL, 'Check Engine Light' that was set off because of a DTC, 'Diagnostic Trouble Code.'  I gave it 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it does, does it well, and is well built.  No E-bay garbage here.    It will not, however, give you a mechanics point of view.  That is training that you will need to buy from elsewhere ;-
</review_text><review_text>
This unit does exactly what it says.  Reads the codes and allows you to reset the Check Engine light.  It also has software to intrepret the codes, but this is very basic in nature and you can find the same info on the internet or from some car mnufacturers.  The unit is very well built and easy to operate.

I bought this reader when my engine light came on. Turns out I could fix the problem myself with a 15 dollar part. The dealership was going to charge me over $100
</review_text><review_text>
The product does just what it says it does.  It helped me realize my Mechanic was milking me for $800.00 when I could have fixed the problem myself for $107.00.  When I confronted my mechanic he said nothing because he knew he had been "had"
</review_text><review_text>
There are more expensive units out there and they might be appropriate for you if you need more information.  But this one is perfect for what I need.

I had "Check Engine" lights on both my 2000 Accord and 2005 Camry.  I wanted to find out what the problems were so I could decide if it was something that needed immediate attention and to find out if it was something I could fix myself.

It found the problems on both cars within a couple of minutes and reset the errors.  The Honda had a "proprietary" error so I installed the database software (extremely easy to install) and looked it up (extremely easy to use).

Turns out both cars had non-critical problems and I could just reset the errors.  This would have cost me $150 at my car maintenance shop.

This device also functions as a pollution control system diagnostic tool.  I haven't tried that yet but it will be interesting to see how that works.

I would highly recommend this for the "casual" user.  Pros would probably need something that does more stuff, but this will be extremely useful for shade-tree mechanics

I purchased this PocketScan to diagnose my engine light, and it does work.
Once it picks up the code, you can then repair. Saves money compared to paying a mechanic to do it and charge loads of money, and it can erase the check engine light once the item is fixed. Its basic, but what more do you need. Also easy to use

Don't bother with the more expensive units that display the explanations of the codes.  This is all you need.  There are plenty of sites in the net that can tell you what the codes mean for each vehicle.  Works great for getting and clearing codes.  If your check engine light is on, this is the tool for you.  Highly recommended

it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets

I'm a little surprised by the bad reviews.  I have used mine for years though I did wear one out after about 80 uses airing up four large truck tires from 12 psi to 35 psi through a 150psi, 2.5 gal tank.  

I have it hard-mounted in my Jeep.  It pressurizes an air tank which is connected to chucks at both ends of the Jeep.  I start the compressor near the end of the trail and by the time we stop the air tank is at full pressure.  Then I connect a hose to one of the air chucks and start airing up tires.  

The compressor runs into the tank and the tank feeds the hose.  I can usually air one tire up in about 30 seconds this way.  The compressor doesn't catch up with this makes it much easier to work - everything is up out of the way and all I have to manage is the hose.  In between tires I can stop to talk and let the compressor fill the tank again.  Or I can air up the next tire.

This unit will not last forever and does not like to be handled roughly.  I have only handled the plug once - to plug it in when I bolted it to the Jeep permanently.  So I don't have the plug problems.

It is noisy but it is the sound you want to hear when you need air.  I remember one night helping a friend who had a flat. They were very grateful to hear that sound and see their tire come back to life.

If you want an industrial strength unit, you are going to have to spend several hundred dollars.  This unit keeps up well with an ARB compressor that costs four times as much.  Treat it well and it will treat you well

I have never had a problem with it at all. I take it on Jeep trips to air 33x12.50x15s back up after dropping the pressure to make the Jeep go in the sand better.  That unit that won't go past 15 lbs pressure surely has a problem. Just last night I aired up four trailer tires to 80 lbs each. Seems like the farther you push the fitting on the valve stem, the faster it will fill the tire. I like mine a lot.

Okay, it is only the second portable air pump we have owned, but it far outlasted the first one! I suppose everyone's experiences are going to vary. We bought our "Truck Air" compressor in '98 for our three week road trip to Alaska (from Arizona!). After it died at the end of this past year, I figure we got more than our money's worth from it (BTW, I intend to buy the same one to replace it!). Seven years of topping off our cars' tires and helping others with roadside flats, filling basket balls and footballs, repeated fillings of a five gallon air tank (to 100psi!!) has proven to me that it has staying power. Not sure what to say about the negative comments on this site about the pump. No problems with ours at all (no "hot plug," plenty of psi, valve clamp always worked well, built in guage accurate to within 3 pounds, more than enough wiring to reach from the cigarette lighter to each of the four tires on our Tahoe)until I just "wore it out"! The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a bit noisy - about as noisy as one of those "pay for air" compressors, but as I said, I still intend to purchase an identical unit, after a shop a bit for the best price. Oh, and another important point, it is "Made in the USA!

this unit works surprisingly well with the following caveats:
1. you must replace the cheap cig lighter plug with aligator style clips designed to be hooked directly to your battery.the cheap connector becomes hot to the point of melting. this is due to the high current demand placed on the battery. 
your mechanic or local car electroncs store should be able to do this for you. also, it will take approx 5 min to inflate your tire. it is a bit slow.
2. you should run your car engine so the battery doesnt run down. the product has a built in fan that seems to keep the unit cooler while running. i liked it for what it is

This is a great convenience. I have 2 of them to hold my EZ-pass in different cars. Much better than digging around for it and holding it up!

GREAT PRODUCT! This tool is very intuitive and easy to use. I find the greatest value is in having the MIL codes internal to the device, which makes finding the faulty component right at your fingertips. I bought the OBDII Fault code book, but quickly learned that I didn't need to have it

I got this scanner and am initially pleased with the capabilities of it as a diagnostic tool. There are, however, some things you need to be aware of. Some of the advanced monitoring functions do not work on all cars. For example, the vehicle identification data does not work for pre-2000 vehicles (but then, I did not need that function anyway). I was able to pull the DTC's from my car, see what it meant (I had one DTC that turned on the CEL), then I was able to read what the sensors were seeing at the time of failure, as well as a great deal of engine data from the "Freeze Frame Data" function. The live sensor data function works partially for my car, again, this is a function that may not work on older cars. The advertisement leads one to believe that this will work for all cars - be aware of this. It can print the results using the USB cable that comes with the unit. The printing function can be enhanced by copying the displayed data into the clipboard and pasting it into an editor program (like Notepad). I found this to be a better way to print the results. The software on the CD is VERY basic - not much help with the codes. There is a LOT more data available on the internet.

The tool is easy to use and easily connects to and from different cars. Some of the advanced diagnostic data that it will capture is not easily understood unless you get some detailed instructions from the car manufacturer. There is a good wikipedia with the PID codes for those who want more information to go through (look up OBD-II PIDS).

This is an absolutely awesome product!   I purchased a new car 5 months ago and vowed to keep it looking great.  I found out that Meguiar's makes premium car care products.  

Here's what I like about it.  It sprays on smoothly and gets off the surface dirt.  (You know, the green pollen that is falling on my new car this time of year?)  It wipes off easily with a paper towel or terrycloth. Also, it leaves the car smelling great.  

It is only used on the car's exterior.  For the rest of the car there is a whole line of Meguiar's products.  I also bought the leather cleaner and car shampoo which I will review later.

So for all you guys and gals who want the car looking terrific in between washes, I highly recommend this product.

I purchased this product because my wife's 1997 Honda Accord's "Check Engine" light had come on.  It turned out to be an O2 sensor that was bad.

The dealer wanted $110.00 for the diagnostic which they would apply towards the $300.65 (before taxes) O2 sensor + $85.00 in labor + shop supplies.  At a minimum, I was looking at over $400.00.  I only paid $95.00 for this product and I can get the same O2 sensor for $150.00 online.  I saved money the first time I used it and the tool paid for itself.

In addition, I can use it for any of my friend's and family's vehicles.

A must have for anyone wanting to save themselves time, money and frustration at the dealer

Bought this, spent 15 minutes studying the manual, plugged it in, and it worked first time -- read out the "check engine" code, and, when later plugged into a PC, allowed the details to be printed in a nice report.  

The only negative I've noticed is that when you reset the "check engine" code in the car's computer, it erases the reader's memory of it, so you have to do the PC printout before resetting the code.

Some folks believe that if you use a device like this on one car it's "locked in" to that car and can't be used on a different car.  This is not true -- I've used it on several different cars with no problems

Tool is very easy to use. Just plug it into your OBDII connector, turn the key and watch it record the fault codes. Then plug it into the USB port of your computer and your done. Software is intuitive and defines all codes captured by the unit and then allows you to create a printout. One use and it's paid for when compared to the hassle and expense of taking the car to the shop. Also prevents fraud since you can tell the shop what is wrong.

This item is easy to use, the codes were easy to read and could be transferred to one's PC via the usb cable provided.  I do not have much experience with other code readers but can't imagine one easier to operate and erase faults with than this one.  For the price I could not be happier.  My only negative comment was with the PC software.  It did not allow for saving the list of codes downloaded from the reader.  In other words if I wanted to keep this info for future reference I would have to print it out.  A minor inconvenience to an otherwise great product

I am a professional Technician.  This little handy dandy tool is fast, easy, and gets to the point of the problem with little to no issues.

Self powered, and can tell you current codes, pending codes, as well as what monitors have been run. Comes with a nice booklet that explains how OBDII works, and has a code chart for most cars.

Well made, Ive had mine for a few years now, its far easier to use then most "top dollar" scan tools.

Cannot show sensor values in real time.
Clears codes - Yes
Shows Codes - Yes
Shows Pending Codes - Yes
Shows if monitors have run - Ye

I was very upset to see a dent the size of a softball on the hood of my new BMW. The dent itself was not all that noticeable, but nonetheless an eye sore for me. After reading very mixed reviews about the Ding King, I had my doubts whether or not it would be effective. I was also very afraid that it would compound the damage. Because of the outrageously low price point, I took a gamble. I'm glad that I did. After three pops, my dent was gone. The process around using the product was simple, though a tad time consuming. I highly recommend this product to anyone with minor dents in their vehicle. I'm not sure if it'll work for everyone, but it worked for me. At $20, you can't go wrong
</review_text><review_text>
I had a small but noticeable dent in the fender and I wanted a cheap way to mostly fix it before committing to a full body shop. Dent King can do some jobs, but not all. For what it does, it's a pretty good product. If you fall into the category where it can help, it's worth it.

It's a "do it yourself" dent repair kit for your car. It "pulls" dents back out and is a fairly good solution for dents that ONLY require pulling "back out". This includes door and shopping cart dings you'd get in a parking lot. It has to be minor, no larger than a grapefruit, and only cosmetic dent damage to a metal panel where there is NO crease. It does not address scratches.

The ideal dent for the Dent King to repair is damage from a blunt object, like a rounded plastic corner of a shopping car dinged the middle of your door and left an indentation that is small, did not cause creases, not on a crease.

I think this is but one tool of an arsenal of tools that body shops use. That means, it is only applicable to a specific type of damage. If the dent looks like it just needs to be "sucked back out a bit", then the Dent King probably can help.

Clean the surface with the included cleaner, which smells like regular rubbing alcohol. Use the supplied glue gun and special glue sticks and dab the melted glue onto the end of the "puller" stick and adhere to the dent where you want to pull it. Allow it to cool, then straddle the "puller stick" with the 2 point brace/bridge, and screw on the tightener to the puller stick. This will pull on the dent via the stick until the glue pops off. This action "snaps" the dent out a bit; depending upon how much force the glue was able to supply. This relies on a good paint job (OEM), as it's essentially pulling on the surface of the paint.

It ends up you will need to do this multiple times to slowly work out the dent

I can still see my dents but they are greatly reduced; that is, for the ones that the Dent King could be applied to. I don't think "good as new" will ever be achieved with Dent King, but it definitely can reduce "ugly ding" to "little annoying ding".

This is one of those products that is just a tool, and really is more dependent upon the skill of the operator. For the price paid, it delivered  value for its cost. But that's it

We love our Lund Tri Fold Ramp! It's a Great Product at a Great Price! 

It's very strong, yet lightweight enough, that one person can handle it. We wanted a ramp that was one piece for stability. Its solid design offers good traction along with worry free loading of all items. No worrying about anything slipping through,....like it could with an open ladder type ramp. The anti slip rubber pads and safety straps make it very secure. The longer length provides a more gradual incline than standard ramps. This adds to their versatility around the home. They're so handy for moving items.....even up and down stair
</review_text><review_text>
This ramp set is just one heck of an item. traction is great and if wanted each of the three ramps can be used alone or all held together by an easily removable rubber hinge system. I like the ramp because it can be used with small wheel products like a lawn mower, track machines like a snow thrower, or even as a great loading platform for my Road King motorcycle. I recommend that the 77" length set be purchased if you can store them easily because of the hinged attach platform to the vehicle and easier load angle. Enjoy!!

I finally got a Snow Brum after living in the northeast my whole life.  I can't believe I've wasted so much time with a regualr snow brush.  And this is a required tool if you have an SUV and hate having 50 pounds of snow slide down your wind shield when ever you hit the brakes.  You can clean off your entire car in about 1/10th of the time.  And this is great for the deep snows too.  In short, if you have snow - YOU NEED THIS

I've lived in Oregon, Colorado and now the Northeast, and seen my fair share of snow. I got one of these from a friend two winters ago, and it's the best tool for snow removal I've used. I still have my ice scraper, since this won't remove ice, but it did wonders for those overnight dumps of 18-24 inches that we got in the northeast last year. I'm buying one for some Florida friends who will be experiencing winter for the first time in the northeast this year

This is a great product.  My neighbor got one and I've been trying to find them in the stores to no avail.  All it is is a sturdy plastic platform, mounted pependicularly to the pole.

My dad also bought this wax based on the ratings in Consumer Reports.  As others have mentioned, the CR review was right on.  

It went on smoothly and has a pleasant scent.  It took a little more effort to buff out, but it was easy to remove from any black plastic/rubber trim.  Although streaking was more than usual, the shine was amazing!  

Three months of parking outside in the sun and some rain, and the paint still shines and feels like there is still wax on it.  

Highly recommended.

</review_text><review_text>
I am the type of person who only waxes our cars twice a year (I figure that's better than nothing). I want a wax that is easy to apply and provides lasting protection (mostly because I won't be applying it again for six months).

I used Black Magic a couple of months ago on our cars and I am thrilled with the results.

It was the easiest wax I have ever applied. 

And, two months later, both cars are still slippery as snot (I couldn't think of a better description). Dirt and grime wash off easily and reveal the great shine that I saw the day I applied the wax.

I highly recommend this wax
</review_text><review_text>
With all clear coat finishes on modern automobiles, the finish may look pretty good even when then outer layer is beginning to deteriorate. So "waxing" is still important. I recommend a fresh application of polish twice per year for maximum protection.
I have been following Cosumers Reports recommedations. Three years ago, their recommendation was NuFinish liquid. This year, CR recommneds Black Magic Liquid Automobile Polish. 
The liquids are easy to apply, and seem to last at least as long as the paste waxes.
In my opinion the Black Magic is at least as good as the rest. I like the cherry scent.

You can clean any kind of metal with this product.  I think you should buy it.  For the most part it's like copper and silver polish, only it's intended for metal.

AWESOME!!! This product is wonderful. Take if from me I have been detailing for years and this exceeded my expectations. To be applied over any wax or sealant will not haze when applied and is extremely easy to buff off. Requires minimal effort at all it's like running a microfiber towel over your car it's that easy. I found that it works the best when applied over Liquid Glass which is a polish that carries a lifetime warranty on their product. You can find Liquid Glass at your nearest automotive store or at a local Autozone. I will keep on buying this product as long as they make it. Mothers recommends using their Reflections carnauba wax before the top coat which I am sure is great I have yet to do this since I love the Liquid Glass so much. The appearance of your car will change dramatically especially if you have a dark car. I recommend before you apply this product make sure that the vehicle has been clayed to remove any contaminates before applying the topcoat. Hope this review has helped you in deciding whether this is a great product or not.

Excellent little assortment of parts here.  It's not for everyone, but for those who can take advantage of it, it's a nice ensemble.  All the hardware is of decent quality and appears durable.  Many of the parts would be hard to get for half the price.  I bought it at a discount price and really had very little trouble seeing high value in it.  Even at the regular price, you would be hard pressed to duplicate it for double.

Here's the deal, I was looking for a good way to move the oil filter to a different place under the hood and this kit did the job perfectly.  The filter on my son's car is on the side of the engine block (Nissan 240SX) and located right above a section of the frame that has holes in the top.  Every time I remove the filter, the oil drains out of the filter and enevitably into the frame (a big wad of shop rags or towels under the filter helps, but not always), then I've got oil draining from the frame for the next week, making a mess all over the driveway.  Anyway, the pump thing with the drain tube running from the pan is unique, but not what I bought the kit for (I only used the filter relocator).  Was impressed with the quality of the fittings and the hoses and everything hooked up like they said it would.  The big plus though.....  it's about one third the cost of any other kit out there (including those listed on Amazon.com)and it comes with adapters to fit just about any car.  Been on the car now for about 8 months with no problems and has made changing the filter sooooo much easier and cleaner....... in fact decided to buy another kit from Amazon for my own car

This product was very easy to install for the average do-it-yourselfer!  It took a little over 1/2 an hour when I was doing my oil change.  All of the needed components were in the box and the instructions were pretty clear.  I was a little skeptical at first about whether it was getting all of the oil out of the crankcase, so I pulled the drain plug on my next oil change once the pump was done just to verify.... all that was left coming out was a minor drip!  Overall a super value for the money and it sure has saved me time and kept me from having to clean up more "oil change messes".  Buy it; you'll be glad you did

This is my favorite wash to use on my car. It suds extremely well, holds the suds well, and the smell of it is quite pleasant. I was tired of car washes that would develop suds effectively but only hold them for a few minutes, leaving you with a bucket of dirty water. Obviously not too good for your car! With Meguiar's NXT, everytime I finish washing my car the bucket is still full of bubbles. I highly recommend this product
</review_text><review_text>
I just used this product to wash my car and it worked great. As it is advertised, a little goes a long ways (1 oz per gallon). The suds feel very smooth and lifted dirt off my car with easy. It is also easy to rinse off. And after washing, my car's surface felt slick as well

The plug is heavy metal and of good quality.  Very impressive.  Looks good
</review_text><review_text>
Easy on and off.  Can apply it in the sunlight.  Makes my Viper shine and the shine lasts a long time
</review_text><review_text>
The price at Amazon was more than $5 less than my local Target store.  The wax is a liqht liquid that's not only easy to apply but easy to remove as well.  I was able to wax my Mercedes convertible in about 30 minutes.  For best results, I would use a microfiber towel to remove the wax and for a final polishing.  The shine is incredible and it leaves the paint feeling silky smooth.  Although it's only been a month since I waxed my car, after 4 washings it still looks great.  This is certainly the best wax I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product

Meguiar's NXT Tech wax is easier to use than any other wax I've ever used, and it brings back the original color of my 2000 red Honda like no other as well.Buy it, use it, love it
</review_text><review_text>
I'm so used to using Zymol, I just wanted to try something else.  So I purchased this stuff, and first off, it makes any car bling like crazy in any type of lighting.  Second, if it rains, the wax stays bling and the drops just roll right off of the car for the first couple of times it rains, then you're outta luck.  But if you live in an area that doesn't rain too much, you can practically not wash your car for a LONG time and just whipe your car down with a microfiber cloth and it'll be just as bling as it was when you first put it on.  For application, you don't need a buffer to make it look really nice because it comes off really easily with a terry cloth
</review_text><review_text>
I am a proffessional car detailer and have used many waxes through my 40 year career. Meguiar's NXT Tech is by far the best wax I have ever used. It leaves a tremendous deep shine and gloss. Keep in mind it is a wax, so it is essential for the best results to use a cleaner polish before applying the NXT. If the surface is clean you could get by with just the wax. I find that it lasts a long time in fact on one of our cars it lasted an entire year and the car sits outside. The key of course is to wash often, once a week is preferable. It leaves minimal residue which can easily be dealt with using a soft tooth brush to get out the excess wax. Every year I strip the wax off our cars and reapply polish and the wax. My 2000 still looks brand new and our other cars as well. I am sold on this product. Give it try and see for yourself. It also smells nice

If you want a deep gloss, a smooth finish, and paint protection, then you will love the NXT. But be advised, the NXT paste, is a better product than the liquid. They both give the same look, but the paste seems to last longer, because liquid have more solvants in them. The paste is not hard to use at all, and the secret is to ues a very Small amount. If you try caking it on, you will have a hard time getting it off, and you will end up with streaks. I have a silver frost Lincoln Town car, and the NXT brings out the metal flake in the paint. The car looks as good as it did when it was new, and it is currently three years old. The cost is a littie on the high side, but don't forget, if you want the best look, and protection, it wil cost you a little more. If you just want wax, get a bottle of a less expencive product ans call it a day. If you want the best look your can have, then use the NXT. YOU WILL LOVE THE RESULTS

I own a detail shop. I have tried many products over the years and have found the polymer products work the best. I use Zaino as my main finish protectant. But did give NXT Tech Wax a try. I always try new products on my own cars before any customers. I waxed both my 2004 auto's in the same weekend, 1 with Zaino's and the other with NXT Tech Wax.  As far as I can see the NXT went on and off as easy, left as deep a shine and seems to stand up to the eliments just as well as the Zaino's. With the only real difference being price I'll be using the NXT Tech wax from now on

The suction cups stay well on the window. I like the fact that I can adjust the size, and it doesn't have all the cutesy pictures. The only problem I had is I forgot I had it on at first, and I opened the car window. The suction cups busted off and got lost inside the door forever. Next time I'd try one that doesn't need suction cups, or supplies extra ones!

 I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE BATTERY TENDER I BOUGHT,I ALREADY OWN 1 AND HAVE HAD GREAT SERVICE WITH THIS PRODUCT. I ORDERED THE BATTERY TENDER FROM AMAZON.COM AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THERE SERVICE. I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER. I HAVE ORDERED A LOT OF PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
</review_text><review_text>
Best item I ever bought. No more over or under charging with a stupid trickle-charger ever!!!
</review_text><review_text>
This charger works great a charging a 12v battery.  It is very small and has two small clamps to attach to the battery.
If your battery is in an out of the way spot, you have the option of attaching a 2nd set of cables which attach to the battery permanently. Then you just plug the charger into the loose end of the cable.  When done charging, unplug hide the cable
</review_text><review_text>
I have an older version of this charger that I bought in the mid 90's. I used it to maintain my garaged Mustang's battery over the winter months for many years. I made a cigarette lighter adapter so all I needed to do was to plug it in instead of using the alligator clips. I have to say this thing is dead reliable! It always kept my battery in prime condition. I love it and recommend it highly. 
</review_text><review_text>
Now I don't have to worry about a dead battery. Just plug the battery into the tender and I know the battery is going to be fully charged for the next start
</review_text><review_text>
If you have a vehicle that you don't use very often, use the Battery Tender to keep the battery charged.  It slow-charges your battery, then maintains the charge.  It works great
</review_text><review_text>
This unit is a workhorse for the money. I use it on my Corvette in the winter and in the summer I have my snowblower attached to the battery tender. This product is compact in size and simple to use. It came with different adapters that enabled use with different battery charging requirements.

I recently gifted a unit to my father in-law who leaves 2 cars in Florida year round.

A must have for anyone who has a vechicle or seasonal piece of equipment.

This is my second battery tender that now maintains my V-ROD. My first tender is over ten years old and continues to function on my son's bike. Very easy to use and nothing to worry about
</review_text><review_text>
For ease of use, The Deltran Battery Tender is an excellent way to charge and maintain the battery on your motorcycle, snowmobile, or even a heavy- duty vibrator, not that I would know anything about that! The kit includes a BMW type plug for machines so equipped, and an SAE adaptor with alligator clips.  You can also wire the SAE adaptor right to your bike's battery and have easy access to the plug- in.  The battery is maintained in a peak state of charge, with no worries of over charging

Easy to read, compact and gives tons of information...direction (digital compass), time, temperature, ice warner, calendar automatically calibrates....what more can I want?! It's great, it's handy and I love it

The best car wax you can get if you like a super shiny/mirror finish. Easy to apply and shine last through several washes. Highly recommended

I was unable to locate this item at the retail stores and was lucky enough to find  the wax at you on-line store. I ordered four bottles and received within five days. I was really pleased and will order again. 
</review_text><review_text>
I have a detail shop that puts out about 400-500 vehicles a month.And we have been in business for 8 years now.  So you can say that i have seen or used just about everyones waxes/polishes. Mothers FX  works great on the old cars as well as the newest 2006 models. I have witnessed the best results with one simple application. And it does last quite some time. It is the BEST product that I have ever used on a black or dark colored vehicles. NO MORE SWIRLS !!  If applied right you will not experience those annoying swirls and small scratches that come with alot of the leading competitors.Anyone can use this. From large detail shops like my own to someone under a tree or at the local self service carwash.IT REALLY IS THAT EASY !! And this product goes a very long way if applied right also. We have been able to use 1 bottle to about 25 vehicles. So it is well worth the price.  So basically you cannot go wrong with Mothers Fx Synwax. It is the best from the best and used by the best in the business.

I LOVE my tink floor mats! They look really good, and are supposedly easy to clean

This is one of the nicest Tinkerbell accessories available.  The graphic is amazingly vivid and should hold up even under the worst of conditions. The mat itself appears to be very good quality.  I don't expect any problems with this item

Simply put, these are the best wiper blades I have ever used. When they wear out, I'll buy another pair regardless of their price. There is no better wiper blade on the market, period. No streaks, no skipping or sticking to the glass, and they lay flat even on the sharply-curved windshield on my '63 Galaxie. Buy them; you won't regret it, and they're a better deal than Rain-X liquid

After much research and trial and error, this product rocks!
Be certain to clean and rinse well before applying to a dry top.

I ended up getting a total of 6 of these units for all the trucks at my work. Overall they work fairly well. No problems jumping our work trucks. Chevy 1500 work trucks and a couple ford F150's. The light comes in handy. The air compressor does take a while to fill up a tire, and the hose is kinda short,but it does work. Other than that, it works great and has a built in battery tester which is nice to see. I have no problem getting multiple jumps in between charges. It recommends charging them once a month even if you don't use them. 4/5 Star

Bought mine at WalMart (USA).  Came in a box that looked like it had not been opened. However when I arrived at the destination where the starter was necessary, (Mexico), the box was short the pieces necessary to charge the starter as well as the extra inflation devices.  WalMart was great and mailed me the missing parts.  48 hours later, after the initial charge, I was back in business.  Both clamps are metal and well built.
Yea, WalMart and Yea, B&amp;D;
</review_text><review_text>
I purchased this exact model and both clamps are METAL.

Maybe it was an issue and they have changed the material.

Seems very well designed and built.

Much better quality than the no-name brands I saw elsewhere

it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets

I got the item quickly, it installed easily, and when it rains it removes water from the windshield - which is what I expected it to do.  No complaints

I got a couple of these a coupld weeks back after watching a Mythbusters episode about submerged cars. For my wife the unit is small and easily added to here key ring. I hung mine from the seatbelt in my car. I had some tempered glass laying around my garage, so I gave it a quick try. It worked as expected. With just a little bit of pressure the glass was punctured and immediately shattered. 

I highly recommend this device, especially give its low price

</review_text><review_text>
Although I have a bunch of things on my keychains, I've decided to start carrying this.  People make fun of me, but that one time you need such a tool, whether inside your vehicle or someone else's, this could save lives.  The punch is powerful and, unlike a standard metal punch that needs your force to break glass, this spring-loaded one is sure to work.  I tested it, but not on glass, and it springs powerfully.

The great sleeve/cover for the blade works well.  It doesn't slip off easily (in case it's in your pocket, etc.), but with a little effort, it pops off as needed.

Just wish I was able to get a single one in the bright yellow color (which comes in 2 packs).

I am a firefighter and find the tool not only useful but space saving and extremely functional as well

I am very pleased with the Solar Shed light.  The long cord makes it easy to use in any spot. Mine ended up under a kitchen cabinet.  It gives off a very nice light
</review_text><review_text>
This SUPER BRIGHT light is great!  

     * Its solar (no need to string wires from the house)
     * It has a VERY bright light (sometimes solar lights can be on the weak side, but not this one)
     * A person could attach it to other places outside to -- it does a great job peircing through the dark night.

DEFINIITELY A MUST OWN IF YOU HAVE A SHED OR DARK SPOT IN THE BACKYARD

I used this to haul a 75-pound, 74-inch-long flat-pack furniture box about 100 miles on top of a 1994 Toyota Camry, and it worked just fine. I had my doubts when I bought it. I lost an upholstered chair on the Washington, DC Beltway once -- tied it down with rope and it took off like a kite. But this Highland carrier did the job. When putting it together, save yourself some aggravation and loop the straps through the plastic bases BEFORE you attach the bases to the crossbars (the instructions tell you to do the reverse, which makes the threading next to impossible). The pieces attached firmly to the roof of my Camry, with flat metal hooks going on the sills of the open doors. Once the doors are closed there's no way the hooks can come out. Make sure the straps are tight before you close the doors. This can be a little tricky as there seemed to be some slippage through the buckles, but with a little tugging and wiggling they snugged up pretty well. Note that the rubber feet that fit on the plastic bases provide grip and protect your roof when the carrier is on, but they fall off easily when it's not in use. I don't know why they weren't permenently attached. The maximum recommended load is 150 pounds but I didn't test it to the limit -- the crossbars look sturdy but they're hollow metal tubes, and they bounced a little under the weight of the box. Also, the bars have a textured finish but seemed a little slippery, so I wrapped some gritty no-slip tape around them (the kind used on stairsteps) to prevent any slippage. I attached the box to the carrier with two ratchet tie-downs (highly recommended over rope). The tie-down straps were looped once around the box and under each crossbar and the box didn't budge the whole trip home. One other thing, make sure to tie up any dangling straps -- the sound of them whacking against the roof of your car can be very disconcerting. An inexpensive solution that's good for temporary use with light loads on short trips in cars that don't have roof racks.     

Update: Used the carrier to haul two of the same box on the Camry, bringing the load right up to the 150-lb maximum -- rock solid all the way. I laid the long boxes side-by-side with the longest width down to spread out the weight as much as possible, then duct-taped them together and fastened them down good and tight with tie-downs and rope (Overkill? perhaps, but better safe than sorry and sued.) My next car will probably be a small SUV, but until then I'm glad I have this carrier. Inexpensive, easy to use and remove and does the job

I collect fairies and was delighted to find this seat covers. I got them and they match wonderfully inside my truck (grey interior), however, my seat belts are located on the seat (i have an 03 GMC Envoy and I think a lot of GMC trucks are this way). So pay close attn before you buy this product.

These seat covers are allot prettier then the picture. Just recieved mine today and I am very pleased...
</review_text><review_text>
The colors were prefect for my car, blues and grays.  The soft velvet gives it a touch of richness.  The image is pretty, but could be a little better quality and well with the embordary.  The colors in the seat are more on the purple side and all the other "Moonsprite" items are blue, so not a prefect match.  Over all I am happy I got it
</review_text><review_text>
They are extremely nice seat covers ,the quality is great for such an inexpensive price. But they were huge in a Jeep Wrangler with no way to modify them to fit and had to be returned. Universal seat covers does say on package "fits most". So if they fit I think it is a good investment

It is always hard to judge a product by a picture. They looked dark on my computer, but I ordered them anyway because I liked the graphic.I am so glad I did. They are actually a steel blue and they look great. I am very pleased and have recieved many compliments. They were easy to install and the quality exceded my expectations. I would recommend them to anyone who loves fairys.

I searched for new seatcovers only to find Hawaiian flower prints in almost all automtive stores. Then I found Amy Brown Moonsprite seatcovers. These were reasonably priced and were not some flower print. There's more to these, they have a soft feel to them like velour. My last set were nylon and some days would develop static and shock me every time I exited the car. The other thing is 
there are other products like floor mats that have the same moonsprite logo

I have an Acura CL TypeS, and I got this steering control when I got a Pioneer AVIC-D2. The unit wasn't too hard to setup, the manufacturer's website is pretty helpful. I did notice that it sometimes is pretty slow to process my steering wheel button presses. Rarely, it also completely ignores them, I have to let go of the button, pause, and press again.

Even with these little issues, I still like the unit, mostly because I can use my left hand to control the volume while my right hand is reaching for the phone, or whatever else

Ordered mine directly from Motive Products for about the same price.  Mine was missing the flexible tubing for brake bleeding and the handle was defective.  After emailing Motive, they promised to send a new handle and the missing tubing.

The unit worked as advertised.  A bit slow but be patient.  Remember to warm up the engine a bit (as directed in the instructions) and unscrew the oil filler cap before drawing the oil out.  Beats crawling under the vehicles and struggling with the oil pan nut!  Will try bleeding brakes with it next time

This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. The Fairing definitely makes the ride a lot quieter, anyone who doesn't like "wooshing" should buy one without hesitation. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car

This is one awesome tool I was able to save big on this scanner; this is a tool that pays for itself. I was able to troubleshoot two of my co-workers vehicle without charging them, one was a BMW &amp; the other one was a Lincoln town's car the next time everyone got to pay the piper. It definitely pinpoints the actual fault code. I had it for about 6 month; I just started to use it. I even found the problem with my 1988 Buick OBD I It's an amazing product. It has all the attachments for OBD II &amp; I, which enables one to get the job done without, having those dealers &amp; shop ripping you off. If you did take it to the shop after scanning your vehicle, you can definitely intimidate those dealership by representing your fault to them. Being that they know what your talking about, they will not tend to make markups suggestion to you, if you know what I mean
</review_text><review_text>
It covers a wide range of older vehicles.  The connections are straight forward.  The more the operator understands about the vehicles system, the more useful the tool.

This unit is also CAN certified and ready to go

Just a comment about the Eagle Talon comment.  In order to use a product successfully one must understand the basics.  I have used this product through a friend and think it is worthy.  I was a Jeep/Eagle technician for many years. Even though it says Eagle on your vehicle it is actually a Mitsubishi Eclipse.  That is why the connector doesn't work.  At the dealership we had a whole separate set of diagnostic tools just to service these types of cars (there were others).  Also OBD1 &amp; 2 is not necessarily meant to tap into other computer systems on your car like ABS, etc if they are not linked.  We also had different connectors and equipment for different systems
</review_text><review_text>
Scanner saved me a lot of time and money. I was able to find out what was wrong with my motorhome without taking it to a garage
</review_text><review_text>
I purchased this item for my father. It has definitely paid for itself! Just a heads up for those planning to purchase this item... The scanner itself is CP9145 NOT CP9150. I had 2 of these delivered and thought I was sent the wrong product each time. According to the manufacturer, a CP9150 is a CP9145 with extra cables included which allow you to test a greater selection of vehicles. Hope this helps
</review_text><review_text>
This series of diagnostic tools does not handle ABS.  I am not certain why ... whether the reason is merely a lack of software/firmware support for ABS or a physical interface issue.

Regardless, this tool has an easy to use menu structure and connectors for any imaginable vehicle

I have to agree with the product description. This is a top quality product that makes a big difference at least for my car. It shines after just one appliance and I am very satisfied with the final result. Highly recommended

way to easy to install! I had it installed and working in a few short minutes, if your looking for a new hoen to replace those little mortercycle type horns they put in cars these days than this is the one you want. Mind you this is not the real loud awsome toned air horns you find on big trucks but it is good enouph to scare the heck out of a moron that cuts you off :-)
Highly recomend these for the price! Great value
</review_text><review_text>
This horn set is a good deal at the Amazon price, and with no sales tax and free shipping, it is about $8 cheaper than the local auto store. I purchased this as the second replacement for a Toyota 4Runner. The compressors tend to rust since they are exposed to water kicked up from roads. This compressor looks better sealed, so that might make it last longer. Most Japanese cars come with weak horns, and this set makes up for them. They tend to scare the unwary (a good thing). The installation is straight-forward, but does require connecting electrical wires and mounting the relay, compressor and horns. To keep it simple, I tapped off the existing horn wire, ran a ground wire to an existing screw and used existing holes in the body panels

Excelente opcion para aquellos que manejan mucho. Permite una buena ventilación en la espalda y el apoyo lumbar es adecuado para largas horas de manejo sin sufrir de fatiga. 
Se le colocó a un Hyundai Getz 2007 y a un Geo Metro 1994 y a ambos automoviles se acopló perfectamente.
El unico punto en contra es que no queda muy claro como se debe sujetarse al asiento y no viene con instrucciones.

I like the looks of these wipers the low profile puts them out of my line of sight. They seem to work as well as any premium wiper blade but I have not had them long enough to tell how well they will hold up.

I was very pleased with this charger. I was considering a portable charger but was advised that it may not work if the battery is too low. My van would not start after some cold weather and my battery was so low that the interior lights were out. After reading info about other chargers I decided on this one.  I read the directions connected it and it did the job. I called Black and Decker and they were very helpful with any questions I had. This is a small price to pay for the convenience, certainly better then having to call a tow truck. It's portable and lightweight, stores easy.I never charged a battery in my life and I was able to do it

I can't tell you what a lifesaver this blanket is. I live in Utah where the winters here can get pretty cold. It definately makes going outside and riding in the car easier to handle. I love it so much, I'm going to give my mother this for Christmas. She suffers from bad arthritis in her legs and feet which is a bad combination when the cold hits her. One of the things she loves, is heat. Even sometimes in the summer she prefers the heat in the car. This of course is not easy from my dad since he's the complete opposite from my mother where he likes the cold. My parents often go on car trips for a few days to get away, and I can see where this may fit in because the heater from the car won't be on so much so both my parents can be comfortable. 

Thank you so much for this product Amazon! :)

After the usual wash and clay bar usage i can sit a bottl on my hood and it wont slide off.. after using the hd cleanes even on the slightest incline the paint is so silky smooth that it will slide right off.. this product is great but, with its dark brown color it can stain some scratches in lighter color cars ( i have a pearl white one) it isnt a bad stain but it is noticeable and hard to get out if not careful.. also consider the applicator that you use with this product for this product only as there is no washing out the dark brown stains... after using this applying the zymol wax is a breeze.. it buffs out much easier and the shine is nic

Great for cars that no longer install ashtrays, example Honda. Traps all odor. Once you get the hang of how it opens and closes it's also easy to use at night. I don't think it's a great ashtray but a great disposal system. If a LD light was installed it would be even better for nightime use

Living in Central Texas is doesn't rain a lot but when it does you'll be glad you used this product.  It also works well when you need to clean your windows with the automatic glass cleaner featuere that comes with most modern cars.

I suggest using a decent micro-fiber towel when using and of course cleaning the glass before you apply Rain-X.  Also, the 16oz bottle will last a very long time
</review_text><review_text>
I have used Rain-X for over ten years now.  I am still amazed at what it does for glass.  The spray bottles or wipes have worked best for me.  Do not apply or buff with a cloth you intend to keep as the chemicals degrade fabrics.  Cheap paper towels do just fine.  Some people complain about glare after applying it, but a good buffing or the next car wash or rain shower will take care of any places you missed.
Windshield, side glass and even my mirrors are treated three to four times a year.  No, it is not intended to replace using wipers, but any consistent cruising speeds over 30 mph and water rolls right off.
I have experimented with spraying rubber scraps &amp; plastics, it degrades and dries rubber trim fast due to the evaporatives in Rain-X
</review_text><review_text>

Great product. Used it for 5 years now. Limit the streaking by two ways: Using a spray bottle, lightly mist a paper towel then buff the glass after product dries. After streaks are detected just use a dry cotton cloth (towel) and buff the streaks out. Not that difficult to have streak free glass. But the streaks will be annoying during night time traveling

I purchased the bike carrier for my cargo carrier.  It arrived without the bolts (I'll tell you about this later). You have to alternate bikes, front tire - back tire - front tire to get all three on.  It's really easy to attach and works great.  You will have to purchase straps to secure the bikes to the carrier.  The carrier is great but Lund International is not.

Now about the missing bolts. The first time I called Lund International the service rep was very friendly, took my address and phone number and said he would send the missing bolts right away. I called about a month later and the friendly service rep appoligized and said he would send them.  I decided to purchase the bolts from the local hardware store instead. I wonder what their warrenty is like if they won't replace missing bolts.  I hope this isn't standard business for the Lund Company

Purchased as a "just in case" and I hope I'm never in a situation where I will need to use it. But at least I feel safer knowing it's there. 

I've only tested this on pieces of wood and plexiglass, and it works as it should. This tool was also highlighted on an episode of "MythBusters" on the Discovery Channel in a submerged car myth. They demonstrated how a tool just like this one and the "LifeHammer" both worked perfectly on the side window of a submerged car. So I'm sold on this tool's ability.

These are easy to use and easier to tighten than the pull through type tie downs.  These will work well to hold a riding lawnmower or golf cart on a light trailer.  They are also good in pickups to hold your load if you have  loops inside the bed.  If you're hauling anything heavier on a large  trailer, get some serious tie downs like the Keeper 05516's

This is a very nice tool.  I find that I can use it easiy for the most common tasks and that's the main thing I care about.

Some of the more advanced features are not so intuitive and I'm one of those dumb customers who thinks it should be.  I think the best-designed tools include an owner's manual for reference sake, but the tool should have an easy enough interface that I don't need to pull out a book with my dirty hands.  

I think they tried to save the cost of a couple of buttons by giving some of them double or tripple duty and thus making it so you need a manual to know how to get where.  I still like my new tool a lot, though.  It does everything it says it'll do, but don't lose the manual

I have been looking for months for the right obd2/can scanner with all the features the Eguus 3130 has. All the other companies models go for 500.000 plus.

I would recamend this product to anyone and even to professionals who need a obd2/can scanner

The scanner worked as promised .The only thing was I had no place to plug the scanner in on my computer. To solve the problem I bought an adapter plug from the nine pin on the scanner wire to a USB which I can plug into the computer.I'm still working on getting past just reading error codes and clearing the check engine light

I bought this scanner as a Xmas gift for my dad.  He's tested it on his GM Pickup and my Mom's Pontiac.  It sync'd up with the cars and worked as advertised.

The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is we haven't had to use it for any serious diagnostic purposes yet - and that's why I bought it

For less than $200 you get a reader with a large backlit screen and one that can also give a live data feed from your car's sensors. It also supports CAN (controller area network) which by 2008 will be a new standard, a standard that Ford and foreign auto makers have already adopted. Did I mention it also comes with a serial cord to connect to your PC? This is a very fun DIY toy you'll enjoy for years

Smaller is definitely better when it comes to power balls.  I bought the original one and it worked well, but was hard to get into the smaller portions of my wheels.  I did not use the extension rod much.  I still used my dremil in some of the corners, but if you want to polish you wheels with less effort than just a rag and some elbow grease it is much better.  The polishing compound that comes with the set works very well also

IN A NUTSHELL: 

WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN IT'S RAINING &amp; YOUR TIRE GOES FLAT IN WAL-MART'S PARKING LOT?

This happened to me today and I was scared out of my wits. I had an hour to get home before my six-year-old son got off the school bus. I was 25 miles away and I just saw my rear tire and knew it had no air in it. I recalled using this product about 6 years ago and that it worked, so I ran into Wal-Mart and skipped the items I had come shopping for and went straight to the automotive section to hunt for this stuff. Twenty minutes later, standing in the parking lot, I read the directions and realized that I had to try to find what was leaking and remove it if possible. After breaking a small screwdriver and bending a key for a car we sold 5 years ago, I managed to remove a nail that was about 4 inches long -- the trouble was that the rest of the air leaked out rather quickly once I pulled out the nail. 

READ AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!

The directions on the can stated that the valve stem had to be in the 8 o'clock position so I had my teenage daughter back the car up until the valve stem was at the 8 o'clock position. I shook the can for over 30 seconds as Angela timed me, then I screwed the hose attachment into the valve stem. It whooshed as a stream of white, foamy liquid rushed through the transparent tubing into the tire. I could hear air rushing in with it but then I recalled what had actually happened the last time I used this stuff about 6 years ago. 

You guessed it, the hole was towards the top of the tire and the foam never got there allowing the air to simply escape very nosily out the hole. Since the flat was in the rear of my front-drive Plymouth Voyager Minivan, I drove it to a gas station that I knew had air, about 6 miles away. I went about 25 mph and many people hailed me as they drove alongside to inform me that I had a flat tire.

BUT THEN SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENED

By the time I reached the Chevron Station with the air, still some 20 miles from our home, I was convinced that I had turned the flat tire into spaghetti and that we would miss the bus. Well, I am happy to report that this was not the case. From traveling slowly, the tire had circulated that white sealant foam and had heated up some due to the extra friction caused by running without air. I filled the tire up and to my surprise there was no sound of escaping air. The sealant held and I drove, at a somewhat reduced speed, the remaining 18-20 miles in about 38 minutes to get home about 2 minutes ahead of the bus.

BOTTOM LINE: HAVE AN AIR SOURCE NEARBY IF YOU PULL OUT THE NAIL

This stuff does work, but after you pull out a nail from your tire it may be rather difficult to get it to hold the air before it can circulate and heat up within the tire. This was my actual experience with this exact product today, and it is consistent with what happened 6 years ago. In short, have an air supply lined-up when you insert the sealant as close as possible to where you remove the nail and insert the sealant. This will reduce the risk of running the tire flat and rendering it unserviceable. If you do this, you stand an excellent chance of executing a fast emergency repair that anybody can manage and, like me, you too might save the day.

[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY.

I've used this product for the last 10 years.  I keep one in my trunk at all times.  The Fix-A-Flat will work on small holes the size of nails.  Shake it hard then add it to the tire like an air hose.  The tire will inflat enough for you to drive it to a local gas station for air

I probably went through 5 different "suction cup" mounted compasses and none of them worked properly.  There are too many magnetic fields in a vehicle for them to work properly without calibration.

This compass however worked great within 5 minutes.

Installation is easy enough, and once it's mounted all you need to do is hold the button down for 5 seconds to put the compass in "calibration" mode, then drive around in circles slowly until it stops flashing.

Granted, you do look like an idiot driving in a circle in a parking lot somewhere, but once you are done the compass works just like one that you would find factory installed.

The only complaints are that the actual sensor feels kinda cheap and it came apart slightly when I was mounting it.  It just snapped back together though.  Also, the back light just stays on for 3 seconds.  I'd rather have it stay on for 10, but you need to think how long it really takes you to read two letters?

If you actually want a compass for your car and it didn't come with one, this is the only one I've found that actually works.

So just buy it.  :

I'm a big fan of the high-end Flukes so I've worked with the best. Well, these defintitely aren't the best, but you can't beat what you get for the price. I got it for my brother for his car and it does the job well.

First, the bad:
1. No auto shut-off. You gotta make sure you turn it off or the battery will just keep draining away.
2. No auto-sensing. You gotta set the dial for the range you're looking for. But hey, I like it so much I don't care that I can't be so lazy.

And the good:
1. All the features. You get all the standards PLUS a tach and a dwell-meter! That'll about cover your carbureted cars.
2. Price. You can find multimeters that can't do the extras for the same price and even more. Great bargain.
3. Alligator clips. Simple things but it'd be a pain without them.

Plus, this thing will handle all the home electrical work.

As for the rest: I won't vouch for its durability but Actron is a decent company. They go towards affordable but not junky. The case is made of a light plastic, but it doesn't seem fragile. As for the tolerances, they're not bad:
DC Volts 
Range:  200mV, 2V, 20V, 200V 
Accuracy : ±(0.5% rdg + 5 dgts) 
Range:  1000V 
Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts)

Accuracy : ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts) 
Range:  750V 
Accuracy: ±(1.0% rdg + 4 dgts)
 
DC Current 
Range: 200mA 
Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts) 
Range: 10A 
Accuracy: ±(1.2% rdg + 5 dgts) 

Resistance 
Range: 200, 2K, 20K, 200K, 2M 
Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts) 
Range: 20M 
Accuracy: ±(1.5% rdg + 5 dgts)

RPM 
Range:  4CYL, 6CYL, 8CYL 
Accuracy: ±(3.0% rdg + 5 dgts) 

Audible Continuity 
Buzzer sounds at approximately less 
than 30-50 Ohms.

So for the price, a good deal

This multimeter is an all around good tool. It has all the features you need plus some of the features that only the more expensive ones have. Like the battery tester and backlight display. I am studying electronics right now and I find myself getting a ton more use out of it than I thought I would. It is easy to use and the instruction manual that comes with it tells you how to perform most common tests that it does with pictures to go along. There are comperable multi-meters out there that cost less but most would cost more. There are certainly better multi-meters than this one but they will cost more. The only bad things I can say about this tool is that the battery is hard to get to. You have to remove 2 screws in the back and pry it apart. Actron should have just put one of those slide off battery covers on it. Also most multi-meters come with some sort of rubber, protective sleeve, that also has a lanyard for your hand so you dont drop it. If this mult-meter had a lanyard and the battery was easier to get out, I would have given it a 5 Stars.

I orginally bought this at an auto parts store and realized that evening (after getting home and doing some online reasearch)that I could buy it on amazon.com for almost half the cost that I payed at the auto parts store.

  Prior to 1998 you could use the MIL (Multifunction Indicator Light) codes on your dash. This tool accomplishes the same thing plus a lot more. In these days of computerized cars it's a necessity if you wish to fix your own vehicle. Don't expect this tool to tell you exactly what went bad and what part to replace. You need to have a working knowledge of automotive mechanics, and a service manual of the vehicle is a great help (almost a must). This tool will steer you in the right direction.
  Example; My car's transmission quit dead in the road without any prior warning. Do I take it to a dealer and spend much $$$ $2400 or so for a rebuild? Not yet. My scanner said "Gears #1,2,3,4 had the wrong gear ratio."  Huh wot??  Well, after examining my service manual,I determined that a sensor that measures input and output speeds must be bad. I bought the sensor for $16.50 and fixed it. By the way, I'm not an auto mechanic. I'm a diemaker

I was tired of buying new wipers every few months.  I live in Minnesota and the salt and cold quickly wear out wiper blades.  I have used these for a couple months and they work great in sub freezing temps.  Best of all, they don't squeak when they are on.  The cherry on top is that the blades carry a five year warranty!
</review_text><review_text>
Really. I've used the 'premium' blades and I've used the cheapo blades. All of them have done an adequate job but none of them could keep up with the kind of thundershowers which seem to blind you on the freeway worse than the thickest fog. That is, until I put Silblades on. The first time I ran into such a rain, I realized that much of what I had previously thought was "out there" was really right on my windshield, a result of inferior blades that simply could not keep up with the amount of water landing on the windshield. Like inferior tires, all of my previous blades (and yours, I'll bet) had effectively been 'aquaplaning' over my windshield, leaving a layer of water that was all but impossible to see through. It took Silbades to show me that a superior blade could improve the visibility through my windshield in 'blinding' rainstorms by 75% or more. For once I could see more than a blur in front of me as I drove the speed you have to in order to avoid getting rear-ended by other blinded drivers.

I have tried many different wiper blades on both my car and my wifes. I thought I take a chance on these after reading some of the reviews. All I got to say now is, WOW! These blades are whisper quiet and clean the glass so well I am very impressed. We had an overnight sprinkle and when I got into the truck the next day the spots were all dry, a few quick wipes with the washer fluid, and it was almost crystal clear!! 5 year warranty, these have to be the best blades out there!
</review_text><review_text>
All I can say is wow... just... wow. I wanted some good replacement windshield wiper blades for the Bosch blades I had (they were about a year and a half old and weren't holding out well). I did my research and decided to look into silicon rubber blades after reading so much about them. I was first going to get the PIAA brand, however the price and five year warranty the Silblades offered changed my mind. I haven't looked back since. 

One of the things I hated about my old blades is they ended up making a lot of noise when sliding against the windshield unless there was a decent amount of water pouring down. From the first day I installed these onto my car and that first rain drizzle came down I was sold. The blades are whisper quiet, even with just a little moisture on the glass. You literally won't hear them. Heck, they are quiet even if you have no water on the glass. All you will hear is the motors that turn the blades. My old Bosche blades weren't anywhere near that quiet, even right out of the box. 

The Silblades seem to work really well in getting the water off the windshield too. I dare say better than any other blades I have used. Some other blades I had would sometimes leave a thin trail of water still on the glass, but not the Silblades. Everything wipes clean from the blade's path. Also it's true what they say about the silicone in the rubber leaving a protective coating. The rain on your windshield will start to bead just like after waxing your car. I can't say it happened immediately because... well my windshield was waxed the day before I installed the blades. However the beading has lasting much, much longer than it should have from waxing alone. 

I live in Houston, TX so I'm love how these blades hold up against the searing heat. No cracks yet or even color fading. I can't tell you how well they do in snow and ice since we don't get much of either here, and I haven't travelled anywhere to test the blades on that yet. However I don't doubt the manufacturer's claims on standing up to the bitter cold. 

The PIAA silicone blades claimed they could do all of these things too. However they were $25 per blade and were only guaranteed to work a year. The Silblades have a five year warranty and the price can't be beat. If you really, REALLY want a noticeable difference in our windshield wiping experience then I suggest you grab these for your own vehicle. You will thank me for it.

This is the first clay bar system I used, and it's still the best. You absolutely need to use this before you wax, or else you're just waxing those impurities into your finish, creating more annoying swirl marks. Doing this step before you wax is a bit more work, but it's worth it. I could live without the Mother's wax they include with the kit, as I don't use it. But I always use this before I wax my car. That glass-like feeling your paint gets is amazing

Product is just outstanding really deserves the 5 star rating it has in amazon.My vehicle had tree sap mist all over its finish i tried many diffrent waxes even tried compond and nothing i was begining to lose hope until a little research on the net about clay bars and ran into this product.It took me about 3hrs to do my entire car and although it was plenty of work i could not belive the result its a mirror finish the paint looks gorgeous highly reccomend this treatment

This product removed overspray in about two hours and saved me a ton of money.  I was lucky to find out about this system and highly recommend it.  It's easy to use, just wash and dry your car, and then in 2 feet blocks spray the lubricant and gently rub the clay bar on your car, wiping off excess lubricant and finishing with the wax included in the kit.  My car looks like it did when it came off the lot! Couldn't be happier

After reading numerous raving reviews here at Amazon.com and at several other sites, and learning that auto clay was safe for clear coat paints because it works through a non-abrasive process, I decided to give it a try -- and boy, was I glad I did!

My car was covered with a stubborn deposit of dirt and grime that simply would not come off with a car wash. It seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and wouldn't budge no matter how hard I tried washing the car. After every car wash, I would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty.

That was when I learned about Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit. The results were astounding! After using it, the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth. The paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it has a new coat of paint! I was immensely pleased with the results.

Unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants, auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay. The clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine (Play-doh®) and it is used along with the included "lubricant" spray (actually, an auto soap that provide lots of suds -- like Meguiar's Gold Class -- will work equally well.)

Mind you, car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches; only a car polish or a polishing compound (harsher) can do that. And remember, always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants. Also, clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new!

I am giving Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit my highest recommendation. Go on, try it and see for yourself firsthand the difference it makes in your car paint. It's worth every penny and I'm sure you'll be glad you did!

I first bought the Mother's Clay Bar system a year ago.  It sat on the shelf until I tried it on my two year old Honda CR-V.
It took less than 45 minutes to treat and wax my whole car and the vehicle now looks better than when I bought it.   You can actually hear those little rust causing impurities coming off the finish.  Stop destroying your clear coat or settling for less than a perfectly smooth finish get this product!  I do not own stock in,  or work for,  Mother's Car Care prducts
